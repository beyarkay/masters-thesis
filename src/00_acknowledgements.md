I wish to extend my sincere gratitude to the Computer Science Department of
Stellenbosch University for their endless encouragement to learn about fields
of which I had never heard and the friendly competition of my peers without
whom I would be half as wise and half as curious as I am today. I would like to
thank Professor Trienko Grobler for taking chance on me when I was an unknown
student, from a different university, with proposal for an Honours project that
could hardly be called a safe bet. Without that chance, I would probably still
be trying to bring \emph{Ergo} to life.

Finally I would like to thank my parents, Dr Lisa Kane and Rob Kane, for
supporting me during this thesis. They have never questioned my crazy ideas (no
matter how impractical) and have always known how to nudge me towards figuring
them out for myself.
