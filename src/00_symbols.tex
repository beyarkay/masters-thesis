\NomGroup{Gesture recognition technology}%-----------------------------------------------
    \item[Accelerometers] These are small microchips which can measure acceleration. Most commonly this is linear acceleration is three axes, but can also include rotational acceleration.
    \item[Capacitance Sensors] These sensors use the changing capacitance of the human body to measure its movement by placing sensors around the user's wrist and then measuring the changing capacitance as the user moves their fingers.
    \item[Channel State Information] Commercially available WiFi routers send large amounts of diagnostics information in order to improve transmission efficiency in a wide variety of environments. This channel state information is very sensitive to small changes in the surrounding environment, such as a human moving around or breathing, and modern machine learning techniques enable this movement to be inferred from the CSI data, given enough labelled training information.
    \item[Electromyography] A general-purpose term for any device capable of measuring the electrical impulses in a user's muscles. Most often this is Surface Electromyography, and is accomplished using non-invasive electrodes placed on the user's bare skin.
    \item[Fibre Optic] Only observed in use in \cite{wiseEvaluationFiberOptic1990}, the author measured the attenuation of the light through fibre optic cables placed over the user's knuckles as an indication of the bend of the user's fingers.
    \item[Flexion sensors, flex sensors] These are flexible plastic strips either 5cm or 10cm long that can measure how much they are bent. They are often placed over the knuckles of a user to measure the bend of that knuckle.
    \item[Hall Effect Sensors] These sensors measure the Hall voltage across a conductor or semiconductor material exposed to a magnetic field. They are often used for precise measurement of rotation around an axis.
    \item[Inertial Measurement Unit] A more advanced type of accelerometer that is often capable of measuring linear and rotational acceleration as well as the earth's magnetic field.
    \item[LiDAR] A remote sensing technology that employs laser beams to measure distances and obtain precise three-dimensional representations of a space.
    \item[Mechanomyography] Only observed in \cite{maHandGestureRecognition2017}, this tracks muscle activation through surface muscle vibration.
    \item[Optical Tubes] This refers to sensors which use a flexible plastic tube with a light-sensitive diode at one end and a light at the other end. The amount by which the tube is bent can be approximated by how much light is able to reach the diode.
    \item[Potentiometers] These sensors use a variable resistance resistor to measure the rotation of an axle. They are frequently used in consumer hardware for knobs and turnable dials.
    \item[Pressure sensor] This sensor has a slightly misleading name, and measures the force applied onto a surface (as opposed to measuring the pressure of a gas)
    \item[Triboelectric Textile] Only observed in use in \cite{wenMachineLearningGlove2020}, the authors constructed a special textile which can harvest energy as it is bent or stretched and can measure how it is being bent or stretched.
    \item[WiFi] See Channel State Information
