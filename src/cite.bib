  abstract = {We present WiGest: a system that leverages changes in WiFi signal strength to sense in-air hand gestures around the user's mobile device. Compared to related work, WiGest is unique in using standard WiFi equipment, with no modifications, and no training for gesture recognition. The system identifies different signal change primitives, from which we construct mutually independent gesture families. These families can be mapped to distinguishable application actions. We address various challenges including cleaning the noisy signals, gesture type and attributes detection, reducing false positives due to interfering humans, and adapting to changing signal polarity. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype using off-the-shelf laptops and extensively evaluate the system in both an office environment and a typical apartment with standard WiFi access points. Our results show that WiGest detects the basic primitives with an accuracy of 87.5\% using a single AP only, including through-the-wall non-line-of-sight scenarios. This accuracy increases to 96\% using three overheard APs. In addition, when evaluating the system using a multi-media player application, we achieve a classification accuracy of 96\%. This accuracy is robust to the presence of other interfering humans, highlighting WiGest's ability to enable future ubiquitous hands-free gesture-based interaction with mobile devices.},

  abstract = {In recent years, several technologies have been utilized to bridge the communication gap between persons who have hearing or speaking impairments and those who don't. This paper presents the development of a novel sign language recognition system which translates Ethiopian sign language (ETHSL) to Amharic alphabets using computer vision technology and Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system accepts sign language images as input and gives Amharic text as the desired output. The proposed system comprises of three main stages which are: preprocessing, feature extraction, and recognition. The methodology employed involves data acquisition, preprocessing the acquired data, background normalization, image resizing, region of interest (ROI) identification, noise removal, brightness adjustment, and feature extraction, while Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for end-to-end classification. The data used in this study was acquired from students with hearing impairments at the Debre Markos Teaching College with an iPhone 6s phone which has a resolution of 3024\,\texttimes\,4020. The images are in JPEG file format and were collected in a controlled environment. The proposed system was implemented using Kera's (Tensorflow2.3.0 as backend) in python and tested using the image dataset collected from Debre Markos Teaching College graduating students of 2012. The results show that the running time was minimized by adjusting the images to a suitable size and color. In addition, the results show an improved recognition accuracy compared to previous works. The proposed model achieves 98.5\% training, 95.59\% validation, and 98.3\% testing accuracy of recognition.},

In this paper, we show that Wi-Fi can also extend our senses, enabling us to see moving objects through walls and behind closed doors. In particular, we can use such signals to identify the number of people in a closed room and their relative locations. We can also identify simple gestures made behind a wall, and combine a sequence of gestures to communicate messages to a wireless receiver without carrying any transmitting device. The paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how one can use MIMO interference nulling to eliminate reflections off static objects and focus the receiver on a moving target. Second, it shows how one can track a human by treating the motion of a human body as an antenna array and tracking the resulting RF beam. We demonstrate the validity of our design by building it into USRP software radios and testing it in office buildings.},

These include algorithms that learn decision trees, classification rules, and distributed networks. However, no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a framework and methodology, called instance-based learning, that generates classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most, minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in wireless technologies enable pervasive and device free gesture recognition that enable assisted living utilizing off the shelf commercial Wi-Fi devices. This paper proposes a Device-Free Wi-Fi-based Sign Language Recognition (DF-WiSLR) for recognizing 30 static and 19 dynamic sign gestures. The raw Channel State Information (CSI) acquired from the Wi-Fi device for 49 sign gestures, with a volunteer performing the sign gestures in home and office environments. The proposed system adopts machine learning classifiers such as SVM, KNN, RF, NB, and a deep learning classifier CNN, for measuring the gesture recognition accuracy. To address the practical limitation of building a voluminous dataset, DF-WiSLR augments the originally acquired CSI values with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). Higher-order cumulant features of orders 2, 3, and 4 are extracted from the original and augmented data, as the machine learning classifiers demand manual feature extraction. To reduce the computational complexity of machine learning classifiers, an informative and reduced optimal feature subset is selected using MIFS. Whilst the pre-processed original and augmented CSI values directly fed as input to an 8-layer deep CNN, it performs auto feature extraction and selection. DF-WiSLR reported better recognition accuracies with SVM for static and dynamic gestures in both home and office environments. SVM achieved 93.4\% 98.8\% and 98.9\% accuracies in home and office environments respectively, for static gestures. For dynamic gestures, 92.3\% recognition accuracy achieved in home environment. On augmented data, the corresponding gesture recognition accuracy values reported are 97.1\%, 99.9\%, 99.9\%, and 98.5\%.},

Sensory approach to recognition facilitates real-time and accurate recognition of signs. Thus, this study proposes a Malaysian Sign Language (MSL) recognition framework. The framework consists of three sub-modules for the recognition of static isolated signs based on data collected from a DataGlove. The first module focuses on the characteristics of signs, yielding sign recognition system requirements. The second module describes the different steps required to develop a wearable sign-capture device. The third module discusses the real-time SL recognition approach, which uses a template-matching algorithm to recognize acquired data. The final design of the DataGlove with 65 data channel fulfils the requirement identified from an analysis of MSL. The DataGlove is able to record data for all of the signs (both dynamic and static) of MSL due to the wide range of captured hand features. As a result, the recognition engine can accurately recognize complex signs.},

Communication through gestures has been used since early ages not only by physically challenged persons but nowadays for many other applications. As most predominantly hand is use to perform gestures, Hand Gesture Recognition have been widely accepted for numerous applications such as human computer interactions, robotics, sign language recognition, etc. This paper focuses on bare hand gesture recognition system by proposing a scheme using a database-driven hand gesture recognition based upon skin color model approach and thresholding approach along with an effective template matching with can be effectively used for human robotics applications and similar other applications.. Initially, hand region is segmented by applying skin color model in YCbCr color space. In the next stage otsu thresholding is applied to separate foreground and background. Finally, template based matching technique is developed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for recognition. The system is tested with the controlled and uncontrolled database and shows 100\% accuracy with controlled database and 91.43\% with low brightness images.},

In this paper, we present a novel device-free WiFi-based gesture recognition system (WiGeR) by leveraging the fluctuations in the channel state information (CSI) of WiFi signals caused by hand motions. We extract CSI from any common WiFi router and then filter out the noise to obtain the CSI fluctuation trends generated by hand motions. We design a novel and agile segmentation and windowing algorithm based on wavelet analysis and short-time energy to reveal the specific pattern associated with each hand gesture and detect duration of the hand motion. Furthermore, we design a fast dynamic time warping algorithm to classify our system's proposed hand gestures. We implement and test our system through experiments involving various scenarios. The results show that WiGeR can classify gestures with high accuracy, even in scenarios where the signal passes through multiple walls.},

  abstract = {Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technologies are rapidly evolving the way we interact with computing devices and adapting to the constantly increasing demands of modern paradigms. One of the most useful tools in this regard is the integration of Human-to-Human Interaction gestures to facilitate communication and expressing ideas. Gesture recognition requires the integration of postures, gestures, face expressions and movements for communicating or conveying certain messages. The aim of this study is to aggregate and synthesize experiences and accumulated knowledge about Vision-Based Recognition (VBR) techniques. The major objective of conducting this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to highlight the state-of-the-art in the context of vision-based gesture recognition with specific focus on hand gesture recognition (HGR) techniques and enabling technologies. After a careful systematic selection process, 100 studies relevant to the four research questions were selected. This process was followed by data collection, a detailed analysis, and a synthesis of the selected studies. The results reveal that among the VBR techniques, HGR is a predominant and highly focused area of research. Research focus is also found to be converging towards sign language recognition. Potential applications of HGR techniques include desktop applications, smart environments, entertainment, sign language interpretation, virtual reality and gamification. Although various experimental research efforts have been devoted to gestures recognition, there are still numerous open issues and research challenges in this field. Lastly, considering the results from this SLR, potential future research directions are suggested, including a much needed focus on grammatical interpretation, hybrid approaches, smartphone devices, normalization, and real-life systems.},

  abstract = {Channel state information (CSI)-based human activity recognition plays an essential role in various application domains, such as security, healthcare, and Internet of Things. Most existing CSI-based activity recognition approaches rely on manually designed features that are classified using traditional classification methods. Furthermore, the use of deep learning methods for CSI-based activity recognition is still at its infancy with most of the existing approaches focus on recognizing single-human activities. The current study explores the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to recognize human-to-human interactions (HHIs) using CSI signals. Particularly, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework that comprises three phases, which are the input, feature extraction, and recognition phases. The input phase converts the raw CSI signals into CSI images that comprise time, frequency, and spatial information. In the feature extraction phase, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to automatically extract deep features from the CSI images. Finally, the extracted features are fed to the recognition phase to identify the class of the HHI associated with each CSI image. The performance of our proposed framework is assessed using a publicly available CSI dataset that was acquired from 40 different pairs of subjects while performing 13 HHIs. Our proposed framework achieved an average recognition accuracy of 86.3\% across all HHIs. Moreover, the experiments indicate that our proposed framework enabled significant improvements over the results achieved using three state-of-the-art pre-trained CNNs as well as the results obtained using four different conventional classifiers that employs traditional handcrafted features.},

People cannot communicate without gestures. Any action or movement without gestures is free of real feelings and cannot express the thoughts. The purpose of any hand gesture recognition system is to recognize the hand gesture and used it to transfer a certain meaning or for computer control or/and a device. This paper introduced an efficient system to recognize hand gestures in real-time. Generally, the system is divided into five phases, first to image acquisition, second to pre-processing the image, third for detection and segmentation of the hand region, fourth to features extraction and fifth to count the numbers of fingers for gesture recognition. The system has been coded by Python language, PyAutoGUI library, OS Module of Python and the Open CV library.},

  abstract = {People with speech disorders often communicate through special gestures and sign language gestures. However, other people around them might not understand the meaning of those gestures. The research described in this article is aimed at providing an assistive device to help those people communicate with others by translating their gestures into a spoken voice that others can understand. The proposed device includes an electronic glove that is worn on the hand. It employs an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyro with 6 degrees of freedom to continuously monitor hand orientation and movement, plus a potentiometer for each finger, to monitor changes in finger posture. The signals from the MPU6050 and the potentiometers are routed to an Arduino board, where they are processed to determine the meaning of each gesture, which is then voiced using the audio streams stored in an SD memory card. The audio output drives a speaker, allowing the listener to understand the meaning of each gesture. We built a database with the help of 10 deaf people who cannot speak. We asked them to wear the glove while performing a set of 40 Arabic sign language words and recorded the resulting data stream from the glove. That data was then used to train seven different learning algorithms. The results showed that the Decision Tree learning algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 98\%. A usability study was then conducted to determine the usefulness of the assistive device in real-time.},

The handwriting gestures are captured wirelessly by motion sensors applying accelerometers and gyroscopes which are attached to the back of the hand. We propose a two-stage approach for spotting and recognition of handwriting gestures. The spotting stage uses a support vector machine to identify those data segments which contain handwriting. The recognition stage uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to generate a text representation from the motion sensor data. Individual characters are modeled by HMMs and concatenated to word models. Our system can continuously recognize arbitrary sentences, based on a freely definable vocabulary. A statistical language model is used to enhance recognition performance and to restrict the search space. We show that continuous gesture recognition with inertial sensors is feasible for gesture vocabularies that are several orders of magnitude larger than traditional vocabularies for known systems. In a first experiment, we evaluate the spotting algorithm on a realistic data set including everyday activities. In a second experiment, we report the results from a nine-user experiment on handwritten sentence recognition. Finally, we evaluate the end-to-end system on a small but realistic data set.},

The control of robotic prosthetic hands using non-invasive techniques is still a challenge in real life: myoelectric prostheses give limited control capabilities, the control is often unnatural and must be learned through long training times. Meanwhile, scientific literature results are promising but they are still far from fulfilling real-life needs. This work aims to close this gap by allowing worldwide research groups to develop and test movement recognition and force control algorithms on a benchmark scientific database. The database is targeted at studying the relationship between surface electromyography, hand kinematics and hand forces, with the final goal of developing non-invasive, naturally controlled, robotic hand prostheses. The validation section verifies that the data are similar to data acquired in real-life conditions, and that recognition of different hand tasks by applying state-of-the-art signal features and machine-learning algorithms is possible.},

  abstract = {Hand gesture recognition is still a topic of great interest for the computer vision community. In particular, sign language and semaphoric hand gestures are two foremost areas of interest due to their importance in human\textendash human communication and human\textendash computer interaction, respectively. Any hand gesture can be represented by sets of feature vectors that change over time. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are suited to analyze this type of set thanks to their ability to model the long-term contextual information of temporal sequences. In this paper, an RNN is trained by using as features the angles formed by the finger bones of the human hands. The selected features, acquired by a leap motion controller sensor, are chosen because the majority of human hand gestures produce joint movements that generate truly characteristic corners. The proposed method, including the effectiveness of the selected angles, was initially tested by creating a very challenging dataset composed by a large number of gestures defined by the American sign language. On the latter, an accuracy of over 96\% was achieved. Afterwards, by using the Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) dataset, a wide collection of semaphoric hand gestures, the method was also proven to outperform in accuracy competing approaches of the current literature.},

These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only nine of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the collective of transformation ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more robust testing of new algorithms in the future.},

Compared to standard HMM systems, the learning procedure is simplified using prior knowledge allowing the system to use a single example for each class. Several applications have been developed using this system in the context of music education, music and dance performances and interactive installation. Typically, the estimation of the time progression allows for the synchronization of physical gestures to sound files by time stretching/compressing audio buffers or videos.},

  abstract = {Speech impaired people use hand based gestures to communicate. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the people are not aware of the semantics of these gestures. In a attempt to bridge the same, we propose a real time hand gesture recognition system based on the data captured by the Microsoft Kinect RGB-D camera. Given that there is no one to one mapping between the pixels of the depth and the RGB camera, we used computer vision techniques like 3D contruction and affine transformation. After achieving one to one mapping, segmentation of the hand gestures was done from the background noise. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were utilised for training 36 static gestures relating to Indian Sign Language (ISL) alphabets and numbers. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.81\% on training using 45,000 RGB images and 45,000 depth images. Further Convolutional LSTMs were used for training 10 ISL dynamic word gestures and an accuracy of 99.08\% was obtained by training 1080 videos. The model showed accurate real time performance on prediction of ISL static gestures, leaving a scope for further research on sentence formation through gestures. The model also showed competitive adaptability to American Sign Language (ASL) gestures when the ISL models weights were transfer learned to ASL and it resulted in giving 97.71\% accuracy.},

The system consists of three modules: real time hand tracking, training gesture and gesture recognition using pseudo two dimension hidden Markov models (P2-DHMMs). We have used a Kalman filter and hand blobs analysis for hand tracking to obtain motion descriptors and hand region. It is fairy robust to background cluster and uses skin color for hand gesture tracking and recognition. Furthermore, there have been proposed to improve the overall performance of the approach: (1) Intelligent selection of training images and (2) Adaptive threshold gesture to remove non-gesture pattern that helps to qualify an input pattern as a gesture. A gesture recognition system which can reliably recognize single-hand gestures in real time on standard hardware is developed. In the experiments, we have tested our system to vocabulary of 36 gestures including the America sign language (ASL) letter spelling alphabet and digits, and results effectiveness of the approach.},

Key to this approach is a 2 stage classification procedure where an initial classification stage extracts a high level description of hand shape and motion. This high level description is based upon sign linguistics and describes actions at a conceptual level easily understood by humans. Moreover, such a description broadly generalises temporal activities naturally overcoming variability of people and environments. A second stage of classification is then used to model the temporal transitions of individual signs using a classifier bank of Markov chains combined with Independent Component Analysis. We demonstrate classification rates as high as 97.67\% for a lexicon of 43 words using only single instance training outperforming previous approaches where thousands of training examples are required.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

For upper limb prosthetics, those technologies have demonstrated a strong potential to aid those with missing hands. However, there are basic interfacing issues that need to be addressed for long term usage. The functionality, durability, and the price need to be considered especially for those in difficult living conditions. We evaluated the most popular designs of body-powered, 3D printed prosthetic hands. We selected a representative sample and evaluated its suitability for its grasping postures, durability, and cost. The prosthetic hand can perform three grasping postures out of the 33 grasps that a human hand can do. This corresponds to grasping objects similar to a coin, a golf ball, and a credit card. Results showed that the material used in the hand and the cables can withstand a 22 N normal grasping force, which is acceptable based on standards for accessibility design. The cost model showed that a 3D printed hand could be produced for as low as \$19. For the benefit of children with congenital missing limbs and for the war-wounded, the results can serve as a baseline study to advance the development of prosthetic hands that are functional yet low-cost.},

It takes the advantages of the color image that provides appearance information of an object and also the depth image that is immune to the variations in color, illumination, rotation angle and scale. With the invention of the low-cost Microsoft Kinect sensor, which was initially used for gaming and later became a popular device for computer vision, high quality RGB-D data can be acquired easily. In recent years, more and more RGB-D image/video datasets dedicated to various applications have become available, which are of great importance to benchmark the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically survey popular RGB-D datasets for different applications including object recognition, scene classification, hand gesture recognition, 3D-simultaneous localization and mapping, and pose estimation. We provide the insights into the characteristics of each important dataset, and compare the popularity and the difficulty of those datasets. Overall, the main goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive description about the available RGB-D datasets and thus to guide researchers in the selection of suitable datasets for evaluating their algorithms.},

In our framework, the spotting-recognition strategy is used, that means the continuous gestures are first segmented into separated gestures, and then each isolated gesture is recognized by using the 2S-RNN. Concretely, the gesture segmentation is based on the accurate hand positions provided by the hand detector trained from Faster R-CNN. While in the recognition module, 2S-RNN is designed to efficiently fuse multi-modal features, i.e. the RGB and depth channels.

Recent studies have demonstrated the vast potential of WiFi sensing in detection, recognition, and estimation applications. However, the widespread deployment of WiFi sensing systems still faces a significant challenge: how to ensure the sensing performance when exposing a pre-trained sensing system to new domains, such as new environments, different configurations, and unseen users, without data collection and system retraining. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on cross-domain WiFi Sensing. We first introduce the mathematical model of CSI and explore the impact of different domains on CSI. Then we present a general workflow of cross-domain WiFi sensing systems, which consists of signal processing and cross-domain sensing. Five cross-domain sensing algorithms, including domain-invariant feature extraction, virtual sample generation, transfer learning, few-shot learning and big data solution, are summarized to show how they achieve high sensing accuracy when encountering new domains. The advantages and limitations of each algorithm are also summarized and the performance comparison is made based on different applications. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges to further promote the practical usability of cross-domain WiFi sensing systems.},

First, we apply a real-time hand tracking and extraction algorithm to trace the moving hand and extract the hand region, then we use the Fourier descriptor (FD) to characterize spatial features and the motion analysis to characterize the temporal features. We combine the spatial and temporal features of the input image sequence as our feature vector. After having extracted the feature vectors, we apply HMMs to recognize the input gesture. The gesture to be recognized is separately scored against different HMMs. The model with the highest score indicates the corresponding gesture. In the experiments, we have tested our system to recognize 20 different gestures, and the recognizing rate is above 90\%.},

  abstract = {Human activity recognition can benefit various applications including healthcare services and context awareness. Since human actions will influence WiFi signals, which can be captured by the channel state information (CSI) of WiFi, WiFi CSI based human activity recognition has gained more and more attention. Due to the complex relationship between human activities and WiFi CSI measurements, the accuracies of current recognition systems are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning based approach, i.e., attention based bi-directional long short-term memory (ABLSTM), for passive human activity recognition using WiFi CSI signals. The BLSTM is employed to learn representative features in two directions from raw sequential CSI measurements. Since the learned features may have different contributions for final activity recognition, we leverage on an attention mechanism to assign different weights for all the learned features. Real experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed ABLSTM for human activity recognition. The experimental results show that our proposed ABLSTM is able to achieve the best recognition performance for all activities when compared with some benchmark approaches.},

  abstract = {Recently, it has been proven that targeting motor impairments as early as possible while using wearable mechatronic devices for assisted therapy can improve rehabilitation outcomes. However, despite the advanced progress on control methods for wearable mechatronic devices, the need for a more natural interface that allows for better control remains. To address this issue, electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition systems have been studied as a potential solution for human\textendash machine interface applications. Recent studies have focused on developing user-independent gesture recognition interfaces to reduce calibration times for new users. Unfortunately, given the stochastic nature of EMG signals, the performance of these interfaces is negatively impacted. To address this issue, this work presents a user-independent gesture classification method based on a sensor fusion technique that combines EMG data and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. The Myo Armband was used to measure muscle activity and motion data from healthy subjects. Participants were asked to perform seven types of gestures in four different arm positions while using the Myo on their dominant limb. Data obtained from 22 participants were used to classify the gestures using three different classification methods. Overall, average classification accuracies in the range of 67.5\textendash 84.6\% were obtained, with the Adaptive Least-Squares Support Vector Machine model obtaining accuracies as high as 92.9\%. These results suggest that by using the proposed sensor fusion approach, it is possible to achieve a more natural interface that allows better control of wearable mechatronic devices during robot assisted therapies.},

Classifying the manual aspects of sign (similar to gestures) is then discussed from a tracking and non-tracking viewpoint before summarising some of the approaches to the non-manual aspects of sign languages. Methods for combining the sign classification results into full SLR are given showing the progression towards speech recognition techniques and the further adaptations required for the sign specific case.

  abstract = {In recent years, the researchers have witnessed the important role of air gesture recognition in human-computer interactive (HCI), smart home, and virtual reality (VR). The traditional air gesture recognition method mainly depends on external equipment (such as special sensors and cameras) whose costs are high and also with a limited application scene. In this paper, we attempt to utilize channel state information (CSI) derived from a WLAN physical layer, a Wi-Fibased air gesture recognition system, namely, WiNum, which solves the problems of users' privacy and energy consumption compared with the approaches using wearable sensors and depth cameras. In the process of recognizing the WiNum method, the collected raw data of CSI should be screened, among which can reflect the gesture motion. Meanwhile, the screened data should be preprocessed by noise reduction and linear transformation. After preprocessing, the joint of amplitude information and phase information is extracted, to match and recognize different air gestures by using the S-DTW algorithm which combines dynamic time warping algorithm (DTW) and support vector machine (SVM) properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that under two different indoor scenes, WiNum can achieve higher recognition accuracy for air number gestures; the average recognition accuracy of each motion reached more than 93\%, in order to achieve effective recognition of air gestures.},

Fingertips are tracked in multiple frames to compute motion trajectories. The trajectories are then used for finding the start and stop position of the gesture. Gestures are represented as a list of vectors and are then matched to stored gesture vector models using table lookup based on vector displacements. Results are presented showing recognition of seven gestures using images sampled at 4 Hz on a SPARC-1 without any special hardware. The seven gestures are representatives for actions of left, right, up, down, grab, rotate, and stop.},

  abstract = {Recognition of hand activities could provide new information towards daily human activity logging and gesture interface applications. However, there is a technical challenge due to delicate hand motions and complex movement contexts. In this work, we proposed hand activity recognition (HAR) based on a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor at one wrist via deep learning recurrent neural network. The proposed HAR works directly with signals from a tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors within one IMU. We evaluated the performance of our HAR with a public human hand activity database for six hand activities including Open Door, Close Door, Open Fridge, Close Fridge, Clean Table and Drink from Cup. Our results show an overall recognition accuracy of 80.09\% with discrete standard epochs and 74.92\% with noise-added epochs. With continuous time series epochs, the accuracy of 71.75\% was obtained. },

  abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

In preprocessing stage, color and depth information are used to detect both hands and face in connection with morphological operation. After the detection of the hand, the tracking will take place in further step in order to determine the motion trajectory so-called gesture path. The second stage, feature extraction enhances the gesture path which gives us a pure path and also determines the orientation between the center of gravity and each point in a pure path. Thereby, the orientation is quantized to give a discrete vector that used as input to HMM. In the final stage, the gesture of alphabets is recognized by using Left-Right Banded model (LRB) in conjunction with Baum-Welch algorithm (BW) for training the parameters of HMM. Therefore, the best path is obtained by Viterbi algorithm using a gesture database. In our experiment, 520 trained gestures are used for training and also 260 tested gestures for testing.

  abstract = {Glove-TalkII is a system which translates hand gestures to speech through an adaptive interface. Hand gestures are mapped continuously to ten control parameters of a parallel formant speech synthesizer. The mapping allows the hand to act as an artificial vocal tract that produces speech in real time. This gives an unlimited vocabulary in addition to direct control of fundamental frequency and volume. Currently, the best version of Glove-TalkII uses several input devices (including a Cyberglove, a ContactGlove, a three-space tracker, and a foot pedal), a parallel formant speech synthesizer, and three neural networks. The gesture-to-speech task is divided into vowel and consonant production by using a gating network to weight the outputs of a vowel and a consonant neural network. The gating network and the consonant network are trained with examples from the user. The vowel network implements a fixed user-defined relationship between hand position and vowel sound and does not require any training examples from the user. Volume, fundamental frequency, and stop consonants are produced with a fixed mapping from the input devices. One subject has trained to speak intelligibly with Glove-TalkII. He speaks slowly but with far more natural sounding pitch variations than a text-to-speech synthesizer.},

  abstract = {Channel state information-based activity recognition has gathered immense attention over recent years. Many existing works achieved desirable performance in various applications, including healthcare, security, and Internet of Things, with different machine learning algorithms. However, they usually fail to consider the availability of enough samples to be trained. Besides, many applications only focus on the scenario where only single subject presents. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a three-phase system Wi-multi that targets at recognizing multiple human activities in a wireless environment. Different system phases are applied according to the size of available collected samples. Specifically, distance-based classification using dynamic time warping is applied when there are few samples in the profile. Then, support vector machine is employed when representative features can be extracted from training samples. Lastly, recurrent neural networks is exploited when a large number of samples are available. Extensive experiments results show that Wi-multi achieves an accuracy of 96.1\% on average. It is also able to achieve a desirable tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency in different phases.},

We have implemented a real-time version, which can distinguish a small vocabulary of about 10 di erent hand gestures. All the computation occurs on a workstation; special hardware is used only to digitize the image. A user can operate a computer graphic crane under hand gesture control, or play a game.

  abstract = {Research has shown that five fundamental parameters are required to recognize any sign language gesture: hand shape, hand motion, hand location, hand orientation and facial expressions. The South African Sign Language (SASL) research group at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) has created several systems to recognize sign language gestures using single parameters. These systems are, however, limited to a vocabulary size of 20 \textendash{} 23 signs, beyond which the recognition accuracy is expected to decrease. The first aim of this research is to investigate the use of two parameters \textendash{} hand motion and hand shape \textendash{} to recognise a larger vocabulary of SASL gestures at a high accuracy. Also, the majority of related work in the field of sign language gesture recognition using these two parameters makes use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to classify gestures. Hidden Markov Support Vector Machines (HM-SVMs) are a relatively new technique that make use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to simulate the functions of HMMs. Research indicates that HM-SVMs may perform better than HMMs in some applications. To our knowledge, they have not been applied to the field of sign language gesture recognition. This research compares the use of these two techniques in the context of SASL gesture recognition. The results indicate that, using two parameters results in a 15\% increase in accuracy over the use of a single parameter. Also, it is shown that HM-SVMs are a more accurate technique than HMMs, generally performing better or at least as good as HMMs.},

  abstract = {Automatically recognizing surgical gestures is a crucial step towards a thorough understanding of surgical skill. Possible areas of application include automatic skill assessment, intra-operative monitoring of critical surgical steps, and semi-automation of surgical tasks. Solutions that rely only on the laparoscopic video and do not require additional sensor hardware are especially attractive as they can be implemented at low cost in many scenarios. However, surgical gesture recognition based only on video is a challenging problem that requires effective means to extract both visual and temporal information from the video. Previous approaches mainly rely on frame-wise feature extractors, either handcrafted or learned, which fail to capture the dynamics in surgical video. To address this issue, we propose to use a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn spatiotemporal features from consecutive video frames. We evaluate our approach on recordings of robot-assisted suturing on a bench-top model, which are taken from the publicly available JIGSAWS dataset. Our approach achieves high frame-wise surgical gesture recognition accuracies of more than 84\%, outperforming comparable models that either extract only spatial features or model spatial and low-level temporal information separately. For the first time, these results demonstrate the benefit of spatiotemporal CNNs for video-based surgical gesture recognition.},

The proposed keyboard can be integrated with devices such as mobile, PC and tablets and can be generated by either printing on plain paper or by projection on a flat surface. The proposed design utilizes measured defocus together with a precalibrated relation between the defocus amount and the keyboard pattern to infer the depth, which, along with the azimuth position of the stroke identifies the key. As the proposed design does not require any other hardware besides a monocular camera, this makes the proposed approach a cost effective and feasible solution for a portable keyboard.},

  abstract = {Digital circuits such as the flip-flop use feedback to achieve multi-stability and nonlinearity to restore signals to logical levels, for example 0 and 1. Analogue feedback circuits are generally designed to operate linearly, so that signals are over a range, and the response is unique. By contrast, the response of cortical circuits to sensory stimulation can be both multistable and graded. We propose that the neocortex combines digital selection of an active set of neurons with analogue response by dynamically varying the positive feedback inherent in its recurrent connections. Strong positive feedback causes differential instabilities that drive the selection of a set of active neurons under the constraints embedded in the synaptic weights. Once selected, the active neurons generate weaker, stable feedback that provides analogue amplification of the input. Here we present our model of cortical processing as an electronic circuit that emulates this hybrid operation, and so is able to perform computations that are similar to stimulus selection, gain modulation and spatiotemporal pattern generation in the neocortex.},

Dataset of a sequence of RGB and depth images were collected, preprocessed, and trained in the proposed deep learning architecture. Combination of three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) followed by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was used to extract the spatio-temporal features. At the end of the classification, Finite State Machine (FSM) communicates the model to control the class decision results based on application context. The result suggested the combination data of depth and RGB to hold 97.8\% of accuracy rate on eight selected gestures, while the FSM has improved the recognition rate from 89\% to 91\% in a real-time performance.},

  abstract = {We are pleased to announce the release of a tool that records detailed measurements of the wireless channel along with received 802.11 packet traces. It runs on a commodity 802.11n NIC, and records Channel State Information (CSI) based on the 802.11 standard. Unlike Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values, which merely capture the total power received at the listener, the CSI contains information about the channel between sender and receiver at the level of individual data subcarriers, for each pair of transmit and receive antennas.             Our toolkit uses the Intel WiFi Link 5300 wireless NIC with 3 antennas. It works on up-to-date Linux operating systems: in our testbed we use Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with the 2.6.36 kernel. The measurement setup comprises our customized versions of Intel's close-source firmware and open-source iwlwifi wireless driver, userspace tools to enable these measurements, access point functionality for controlling both ends of the link, and Matlab (or Octave) scripts for data analysis. We are releasing the binary of the modified firmware, and the source code to all the other components.},

  abstract = {In recent years, with the development of wireless sensing technology and the widespread popularity of WiFi devices, human perception based on WiFi has become possible, and gesture recognition has become an active topic in the field of human-computer interaction. As a kind of gesture, sign language is widely used in life. The establishment of an effective sign language recognition system can help people with aphasia and hearing impairment to better interact with the computer and facilitate their daily life. For this reason, this paper proposes a contactless fine-grained gesture recognition method using Channel State Information (CSI), namely Wi-SL. This method uses a commercial WiFi device to establish the correlation mapping between the amplitude and phase difference information of the subcarrier level in the wireless signal and the sign language action, without requiring the user to wear any device. We combine an efficient denoising method to filter environmental interference with an effective selection of optimal subcarriers to reduce the computational cost of the system. We also use K-means combined with a Bagging algorithm to optimize the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification (KSB) model to enhance the classification of sign language action data. We implemented the algorithms and evaluated them for three different scenarios. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of Wi-SL gesture recognition can reach 95.8\%, which realizes device-free, non-invasive, high-precision sign language gesture recognition.},

Beyond the shoulder-worn system, there is no instrumentation of the user or environment. Foremost, the system allows the wearer to use their hands, arms and legs as graphical, interactive surfaces. Users can also transiently appropriate surfaces from the environment to expand the interactive area (e.g., books, walls, tables). On such surfaces - without any calibration - OmniTouch provides capabilities similar to that of a mouse or touchscreen: X and Y location in 2D interfaces and whether fingers are "clicked" or hovering, enabling a wide variety of interactions. Reliable operation on the hands, for example, requires buttons to be 2.3cm in diameter. Thus, it is now conceivable that anything one can do on today's mobile devices, they could do in the palm of their hand.},

  abstract = {Gesture recognition is mainly apprehensive on analyzing the functionality of human wits. The main goal of gesture recognition is to create a system which can recognize specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. Hand gestures provide a separate complementary modality to speech for expressing ones ideas. Information associated with hand gestures in a conversation is degree, discourse structure, spatial and temporal structure. The approaches present can be mainly divided into Data-Glove Based and Vision Based approaches. An important face feature point is the nose tip. Since nose is the highest protruding point from the face. Besides that, it is not affected by facial expressions. Another important function of the nose is that it is able to indicate the head pose. Knowledge of the nose location will enable us to align an unknown 3D face with those in a face database. Eye detection is divided into eye position detection and eye contour detection. Existing works in eye detection can be classified into two major categories: traditional image-based passive approaches and the active IR based approaches. The former uses intensity and shape of eyes for detection and the latter works on the assumption that eyes have a reflection under near IR illumination and produce bright/dark pupil effect. The traditional methods can be broadly classified into three categories: template based methods, appearance based methods and feature based methods. The purpose of this paper is to compare various human Gesture recognition systems for interfacing machines directly to human wits without any corporeal media in an ambient environment.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comparison of various classification methods for the problem of recognizing grasp types involved in object manipulations performed with a data glove. Conventional wisdom holds that data gloves need calibration in order to obtain accurate results. However, calibration is a time-consuming process, inherently user-specific, and its results are often not perfect. In contrast, the present study aims at evaluating recognition methods that do not require prior calibration of the data glove, by using raw sensor readings as input features and mapping them directly to different categories of hand shapes. An experiment was carried out, where test persons wearing a data glove had to grasp physical objects of different shapes corresponding to the various grasp types of the Schlesinger taxonomy. The collected data was analyzed with 28 classifiers including different types of neural networks, decision trees, Bayes nets, and lazy learners. Each classifier was analyzed in six different settings, representing various application scenarios with differing generalization demands. The results of this work are twofold: (1) We show that a reasonably well to highly reliable recognition of grasp types can be achieved - depending on whether or not the glove user is among those training the classifier - even with uncalibrated data gloves. (2) We identify the best performing classification methods for recognition of various grasp types. To conclude, cumbersome calibration processes before productive usage of data gloves can be spared in many situations.},

  abstract = {Most recently, gesture recognition has increasingly attracted intense academic and industrial interest due to its various applications in daily life, such as home automation, mobile games. Present approaches for gesture recognition, mainly including vision-based, sensor-based and RF-based, all have certain limitations which hinder their practical use in some scenarios. For example, the vision-based approaches fail to work well in poor light conditions and the sensor-based ones require users to wear devices. To address these, we propose WiG in this paper, a device-free gesture recognition system based solely on Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi infrastructures and devices. Compared with existing Radio Frequency (RF)-based systems, WiG stands out for its systematic simplicity, extremely low cost and high practicability. We implemented WiG in indoor environment and conducted experiments to evaluate its performance in two typical scenarios. The results demonstrate that WiG can achieve an average recognition accuracy of 92\% in line-of-sight scenario and average accuracy of 88\% in the none-line-of sight scenario.},

To get the actual joint angles from the DataGlove sensor values, a least-squares fit is used to find the best-fit exponential curve for each sensor, and then the correlation between the sensors is reduced by the iterative correlation elimination procedure. The calibration depends both on the wearer and the particular DataGlove being used. The first level calibration is simple and can be done in under 15 minutes with a little experience. The second level is fixed and requires no adjustments. To control the hand, a mapping from the DataGlove angles to the hand angles is applied, making the hand fingertips follow the DataGlove fingertips. The hand can successfully implement various high-level tasks under the DataGlove wearer's control.{$<<$}ETX{$>>$}},

  abstract = {Conversing to a person with hearing disability is always a major challenge. Sign language has indelibly become the ultimate panacea and is a very powerful tool for individuals with hearing and speech disability to communicate their feelings and opinions to the world. It makes the integration process between them and others smooth and less complex. However, the invention of sign language alone, is not enough . There are many strings attached to this boon.The sign gestures often get mixed and confused for someone who has never learnt it or knows it in a different language. However, this communication gap which has existed for years can now be narrowed with the introduction of various techniques to automate the detection of sign gestures . In this paper, we introduce a Sign Language recognition using American Sign Language. In this study, the user must be able to capture images of the hand gesture using web camera and the system shall predict and display the name of the captured image. We use the HSV colour algorithm to detect the hand gesture and set the background to black. The images undergo a series of processing steps which include various Computer vision techniques such as the conversion to grayscale, dilation and mask operation. And the region of interest which, in our case is the hand gesture is segmented. The features extracted are the binary pixels of the images. We make use of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for training and to classify the images. We are able to recognise 10 American Sign gesture alphabets with high accuracy. Our model has achieved a remarkable accuracy of above 90\%.},

  abstract = {Human activity recognition has gained importance in recent years due to its applications in various fields such as health, security and surveillance, entertainment, and intelligent environments. A significant amount of work has been done on human activity recognition and researchers have leveraged different approaches, such as wearable, object-tagged, and devicefree, to recognize human activities. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of the work conducted over the period 2010-2018 in various areas of human activity recognition with main focus on device-free solutions. The device-free approach is becoming very popular due to the fact that the subject is not required to carry anything, instead, the environment is tagged with devices to capture the required information. We propose a new taxonomy for categorizing the research work conducted in the field of activity recognition and divide the existing literature into three sub-areas: action-based, motion-based, and interactionbased. We further divide these areas into ten different sub-topics and present the latest research work in these sub-topics. Unlike previous surveys which focus only on one type of activities, to the best of our knowledge, we cover all the sub-areas in activity recognition and provide a comparison of the latest research work in these sub-areas. Specifically, we discuss the key attributes and design approaches for the work presented. Then we provide extensive analysis based on 10 important metrics, to give the reader, a complete overview of the state-of-the-art techniques and trends in different sub-areas of human activity recognition. In the end, we discuss open research issues and provide future research directions in the field of human activity recognition.},

  abstract = {A new method is developed using the hidden Markov model (HMM) based technique. To handle nongesture patterns, we introduce the concept of a threshold model that calculates the likelihood threshold of an input pattern and provides a confirmation mechanism for the provisionally matched gesture patterns. The threshold model is a weak model for all trained gestures in the sense that its likelihood is smaller than that of the dedicated gesture model for a given gesture. Consequently, the likelihood can be used as an adaptive threshold for selecting proper gesture model. It has, however, a large number of states and needs to be reduced because the threshold model is constructed by collecting the states of all gesture models in the system. To overcome this problem, the states with similar probability distributions are merged, utilizing the relative entropy measure. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully extract trained gestures from continuous hand motion with 93.14\% reliability.},

  abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

This issue has been solved by using single deep networks to learn spatiotemporal characteristics from video data, and this approach is still insufficient to handle both problems at the same time. As a result, the researchers fused various models to allow for the effective collection of important shape information as well as precise spatiotemporal variation of gestures. In this study, we collected the dynamic dataset for twenty meaningful words of Arabic sign language (ArSL) using a Microsoft Kinect v2 camera. The recorded data included 7350 red, green, and blue (RGB) videos and 7350 depth videos. We proposed four deep neural networks models using 2D and 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to cover all feature extraction methods and then passing these features to the recurrent neural network (RNN) for sequence classification. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are two types of using RNN. Also, the research included evaluation fusion techniques for several types of multiple models.

The algorithm was tested on a low-memory Arduino board with 2 Kb static RAM low-power microcontroller. The dependences of the accuracy and time of image recognition on the number of neurons in the reservoir have been investigated. The memory allocation demonstrates that the algorithm stores all the necessary information in RAM without using additional data storage, and operates with original images without preliminary processing. The simple structure of the algorithm, with appropriate training, can be adapted for wide practical application, for example, for creating mobile biosensors for early diagnosis of adverse events in medicine. The study results are important for the implementation of artificial intelligence on peripheral constrained IoT devices and for edge computing.},

This paper introduces the development of a wristband for detecting eight air gestures and four surface gestures at two different force levels through sEMG and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor fusion. To validate the wrist-worn device, ten healthy subjects performed hand gesture recognition experiments resulting in a total average recognition rate of 92.6\% for air gestures and 88.8\% for surface gestures.

This task has broad social impact, but is still very challenging due to the complexity and large variations in hand actions. Existing methods for SLR use hand-crafted features to describe sign language motion and build classification models based on those features. However, it is difficult to design reliable features to adapt to the large variations of hand gestures. To approach this problem, we propose a novel 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) which extracts discriminative spatial-temporal features from raw video stream automatically without any prior knowledge, avoiding designing features. To boost the performance, multi-channels of video streams, including color information, depth clue, and body joint positions, are used as input to the 3D CNN in order to integrate color, depth and trajectory information. We validate the proposed model on a real dataset collected with Microsoft Kinect and demonstrate its effectiveness over the traditional approaches based on hand-crafted features.},

The outcome of which is a system capable of running in real-time, and generating extremely high recognition rates for large lexicons with as little as a single training instance per sign. We demonstrate classification rates as high as 92\% for a lexicon of 164 words with extremely low training requirements outperforming previous approaches where thousands of training examples are required.},

  abstract = {The real-time monitoring of human movement can provide valuable information regarding an individual's degree of functional ability and general level of activity. This paper presents the implementation of a real-time classification system for the types of human movement associated with the data acquired from a single, waist-mounted triaxial accelerometer unit. The major advance proposed by the system is to perform the vast majority of signal processing onboard the wearable unit using embedded intelligence. In this way, the system distinguishes between periods of activity and rest, recognizes the postural orientation of the wearer, detects events such as walking and falls, and provides an estimation of metabolic energy expenditure. A laboratory-based trial involving six subjects was undertaken, with results indicating an overall accuracy of 90.8\% across a series of 12 tasks (283 tests) involving a variety of movements related to normal daily activities. Distinction between activity and rest was performed without error; recognition of postural orientation was carried out with 94.1\% accuracy, classification of walking was achieved with less certainty (83.3\% accuracy), and detection of possible falls was made with 95.6\% accuracy. Results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an accelerometry-based, real-time movement classifier using embedded intelligence},

Gesture commands freely trainable by the user can be used for controlling external devices with handheld wireless sensor unit. Two user studies are presented. The first study concerns finding gestures for controlling a design environment (Smart Design Studio), TV, VCR, and lighting. The results indicate that different people usually prefer different gestures for the same task, and hence it should be possible to personalise them. The second user study concerns evaluating the usefulness of the gesture modality compared to other interaction modalities for controlling a design environment. The other modalities were speech, RFID-based physical tangible objects, laser-tracked pen, and PDA stylus. The results suggest that gestures are a natural modality for certain tasks, and can augment other modalities. Gesture commands were found to be natural, especially for commands with spatial association in design environment control.},

We introduce AllSee, the first gesture-recognition system that can operate on a range of computing devices including those with no batteries. AllSee consumes three to four orders of magnitude lower power than state-of-the-art systems and can enable always-on gesture recognition for smartphones and tablets. It extracts gesture information from existing wireless signals (e.g., TV transmissions), but does not incur the power and computational overheads of prior wireless approaches. We build AllSee prototypes that can recognize gestures on RFID tags and power-harvesting sensors. We also integrate our hardware with an off-the-shelf Nexus S phone and demonstrate gesture recognition in through-the-pocket scenarios. Our results show that AllSee achieves classification accuracies as high as 97\% over a set of eight gestures.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Based on its built-in accelerometer, hand movements are detected and classified into previously trained gestures. A software library for accelerometer-based gesture recognition and a demonstration iPhone application have been developed. The system allows the training and recognition of free-from hand gestures. Discrete hidden Markov models form the core part of the gesture recognition apparatus. Five test gestures have been defined and used to evaluate the performance of the application. The evaluation shows that with 10 training repetitions, an average recognition rate of over 90 percent can be achieved.},

  abstract = {Mathematical notation evolves like all languages do. As new experiments are made, we sometimes witness the survival of the fittest, sometimes the survival of the most familiar. A healthy conservatism keeps things from changing too rapidly; a healthy radicalism keeps things in tune with new theoretical emphases. Our mathematical language continues to improve, just as "the d-ism of Leibniz overtook the dotage of Newton" in past centuries [4, Chapter 4]. In 1970 I began teaching a class at Stanford University entitled Concrete Mathematics. The students and I studied how to manipulate formulas in continuous and discrete mathematics, and the problems we investigated were often inspired by new developments in computer science. As the years went by we began to see that a few changes in notational traditions would greatly facilitate our work. The notes from that class have recently been published in a book [15], and as I wrote the final drafts of that book I learned to my surprise that two of the notations we had been using were considerably more useful than I had previously realized. The ideas "clicked" so well, in fact, that I've decided to write this article, blatantly attempting to promote these notations among the mathematicians who have no use for [15]. I hope that within five years everybody will be able to use these notations in published papers without needing to explain what they mean. The notations I'm talking about are (1) Iverson's convention for characteristic functions; and (2) the "right" notation for Stirling numbers, at last.},

  abstract = {For many applications, hand gesture recognition systems that rely on biosignal data exclusively are mandatory. Usually, theses systems have to be affordable, reliable as well as mobile. The hand is moved due to muscle contractions that cause motions of the forearm skin. Theses motions can be captured with cheap and reliable accelerometers placed around the forearm. Since accelerometers can also be integrated into mobile systems easily, the possibility of a robust hand gesture recognition based on accelerometer signals is evaluated in this work. For this, a neural network architecture consisting of two different kinds of recurrent neural network (RNN) cells is proposed. Experiments on three databases reveal that this relatively small network outperforms by far state-of-the-art hand gesture recognition approaches that rely on multi-modal data. The combination of accelerometer data and an RNN forms a robust hand gesture classification system, i.e., the performance of the network does not vary a lot between subjects and it is outstanding for amputees. Furthermore, the proposed network uses only 5 ms short windows to classify the hand gestures. Consequently, this approach allows for a quick, and potentially delay-free hand gesture detection.},

In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a hierarchical structure enabling offline-working convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to operate online efficiently by using sliding window approach. The proposed architecture consists of two models: (1) A detector which is a lightweight CNN architecture to detect gestures and (2) a classifier which is a deep CNN to classify the detected gestures. In order to evaluate the single-time activations of the detected gestures, we propose to use Levenshtein distance as an evaluation metric since it can measure misclassifications, multiple detections, and missing detections at the same time. We evaluate our architecture on two publicly available datasets - EgoGesture and NVIDIA Dynamic Hand Gesture Datasets - which require temporal detection and classification of the performed hand gestures. ResNeXt-101 model, which is used as a classifier, achieves the state-of-the-art offline classification accuracy of 94.04\% and 83.82\% for depth modality on EgoGesture and NVIDIA benchmarks, respectively. In real-time detection and classification, we obtain considerable early detections while achieving performances close to offline operation.

SpotFi only uses information that is already exposed by WiFi chips and does not require any hardware or firmware changes, yet achieves the same accuracy as state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.},

Communication barriers exist for members of these populations during daily interactions with those who are unable to understand or use sign language. Advancements in technology and machine learning techniques have led to the development of innovative approaches for gesture recognition. This literature review focuses on analyzing studies that use wearable sensor-based systems to classify sign language gestures. A review of 72 studies from 1991 to 2019 was performed to identify trends, best practices, and common challenges. Attributes including sign language variation, sensor configuration, classification method, study design, and performance metrics were analyzed and compared. Results from this literature review could aid in the development of user-centred and robust wearable sensor-based systems for sign language recognition.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a hand gesture based control of an omnidirectional wheelchair using inertial measurement unit (IMU) and myoelectric units as wearable sensors. Seven common gestures are recognized and classified using shape based feature extraction and Dendogram Support Vector Machine (DSVM) classifier. The dynamic gestures are mapped to the omnidirectional motion commands to navigate the wheelchair. A single IMU is used to measure the wrist tilt angle and acceleration in three axis. EMG signals are extracted from two forearm muscles namely Extensor Carpi Radialis and Flexor Carpi Radialis and processed to provide Root Mean Square (RMS) signal. Initiation and termination of dynamic activities are based on autonomous identification of static to dynamic or dynamic to static transition by setting static thresholds on processed IMU and myoelectric sensor data. Classification involves recognizing the activity pattern based on periodic shape of trajectories of the triaxial wrist tilt angle and EMG-RMS from the two selected muscles. Second order Polynomial coefficients extracted from the sensor trajectory templates during specific dynamic activity cycles are used as features to classify dynamic activities. Classification algorithm and real time navigation of the wheelchair using the proposed algorithm has been tested by five healthy subjects. Classification accuracy of 94\% was achieved by DSVM classifier on `k' fold cross validation data of 5 users. Classification accuracy while operating the wheelchair was 90.5\%.},

  abstract = {In this article, a real-time dynamic finger gesture recognition using a soft sensor embedded data glove is presented, which measures the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint angles of five fingers. In the gesture recognition field, a challenging problem is that of separating meaningful dynamic gestures from a continuous data stream. Unconscious hand motions or sudden tremors, which can easily lead to segmentation ambiguity, makes this problem difficult. Furthermore, the hand shapes and speeds of users differ when performing the same dynamic gesture, and even those made by one user often vary. To solve the problem of separating meaningful dynamic gestures, we propose a deep learning-based gesture spotting algorithm that detects the start/end of a gesture sequence in a continuous data stream. The gesture spotting algorithm takes window data and estimates a scalar value named gesture progress sequence (GPS). GPS is a quantity that represents gesture progress. Moreover, to solve the gesture variation problem, we propose a sequence simplification algorithm and a deep learning-based gesture recognition algorithm. The proposed three algorithms (gesture spotting algorithm, sequence simplification algorithm, and gesture recognition algorithm) are unified into the real-time gesture recognition system and the system was tested with 11 dynamic finger gestures in real-time. The proposed system took only 6 ms to estimate a GPS and no more than 12 ms to recognize the completed gesture in real-time.},

  abstract = {Gesturing is an instinctive way of communicating to present a specific meaning or intent. Therefore, research into sign language interpretation using gestures has been explored progressively during recent decades to serve as an auxiliary tool for deaf and mute people to blend into society without barriers. In this paper, a smart sign language interpretation system using a wearable hand device is proposed to meet this purpose. This wearable system utilizes five flex-sensors, two pressure sensors, and a three-axis inertial motion sensor to distinguish the characters in the American sign language alphabet. The entire system mainly consists of three modules: 1) a wearable device with a sensor module; 2) a processing module; and 3) a display unit mobile application module. Sensor data are collected and analyzed using a built-in embedded support vector machine classifier. Subsequently, the recognized alphabet is further transmitted to a mobile device through Bluetooth low energy wireless communication. An Android-based mobile application was developed with a text-to-speech function that converts the received textinto audible voice output. Experiment results indicate that a true sign language recognition accuracy rate of 65.7\% can be achieved on average in the first version without pressure sensors. A second version of the proposed wearable system with the fusion of pressure sensors on the middle finger increased the recognition accuracy rate dramatically to 98.2\%. The proposed wearable system outperforms the existing method, for instance, although background lights, and other factors are crucial to a vision-based processing method, they are not for the proposed system.},

These include visual servoing of robotic arms on specific target objects, Augmented Reality systems that require real-time registration of the object to be augmented, and head tracking systems that sophisticated interfaces can use. Computer Vision offers solutions that are cheap, practical and non-invasive.This survey reviews the different techniques and approaches that have been developed by industry and research. First, important mathematical tools are introduced: Camera representation, robust estimation and uncertainty estimation. Then a comprehensive study is given of the numerous approaches developed by the Augmented Reality and Robotics communities, beginning with those that are based on point or planar fiducial marks and moving on to those that avoid the need to engineer the environment by relying on natural features such as edges, texture or interest. Recent advances that avoid manual initialization and failures due to fast motion are also presented. The survery concludes with the different possible choices that should be made when implementing a 3D tracking system and a discussion of the future of vision-based 3D tracking.Because it encompasses many computer vision techniques from low-level vision to 3D geometry and includes a comprehensive study of the massive literature on the subject, this survey should be the handbook of the student, the researcher, or the engineer who wants to implement a 3D tracking system.},

  abstract = {Automatic dynamic sign language recognition is even more challenging than gesture recognition due to the fact that the vocabularies are large and signs are context dependent. Previous works in this direction tend to build classifiers based on complex hand-crafted features computed from the raw inputs. As a type of deep learning model, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly advanced the accuracy of human gesture classification. However, such methods are currently used to treat video frames as 2D images and recognize gestures at the individual frame level. In this paper, we present a data driven system in which 3D-CNNs are applied to extract spatial and temporal features from video streams, and the motion information is captured by noting the variation in depth between each pair of consecutive frames. To further boost the performance, multi-modal of video streams, including infrared, contour and skeleton are used as input for the architecture and the prediction results estimated from the different sub-networks were fused together. In order to validate our method, we introduce a new challenging multi-modal dynamic sign language dataset captured with Kinect sensors. We evaluate the proposed approach on the collected dataset and achieve superior performance. Moreover, our method achieves a mean Jaccard Index score of 0.836 on the ChaLearn Looking at People Gesture datasets.},

However, because of the complexity of dynamic gestures, most researches are focused either on static gestures, postures, or a small set of dynamic gestures. As real-time recognition of a large set of dynamic gestures is considered, some efficient algorithms and models are needed. To solve this problem in Taiwanese Sign Language, a statistics based context sensitive model is presented and both gestures and postures can be successfully recognized. A gesture is decomposed as a sequence of postures and the postures can be quickly recognized using hidden Markov model. With the probability resulted from hidden Markov model and the probability of each gesture in a lexicon, a gesture can be easily recognized in a linguistic way in real-time.},

Gesture recognition through smart devices is becoming a popular research direction. This paper proposes a hand gesture recognition and real-time game control system that is capable of continues human-computer interaction in view of an off-the-rack business wearable wristband. We utilize three-axis accelerator and gyroscope sensors embedded in smart band to collect hand motion information and use Kinect camera capture video information for manual segmentation during the training model phase. A continuous gesture segmentation algorithm based on sliding window and DTW algorithm is developed to detect meaningful gestures in the real-time game control stage. In addition, an android game named Fly Birds which is controlled by gesture recognition result is presented to simulate real-time human-computer interaction. Then, we classify the data in the window using common classifiers. Finally, our experimental results show that, we can accurately identify the designed gestures during the stage of static gesture recognition, and we also achieve a perfect interactive effect in the process of dynamic real-time game control. The experiment outcomes will advance the ascent of human-PC cooperation in view of hand gesture recognition and related applications will rise in vast numbers.},

  abstract = {Indoor human tracking is fundamental to many real-world applications such as security surveillance, behavioral analysis, and elderly care. Previous solutions usually require dedicated device being carried by the human target, which is inconvenient or even infeasible in scenarios such as elderly care and break-ins. However, compared with device-based tracking, device-free tracking is particularly challenging because the much weaker reflection signals are employed for tracking. The problem becomes even more difficult with commodity Wi-Fi devices, which have limited number of antennas, small bandwidth size, and severe hardware noise.             In this work, we propose IndoTrack, a device-free indoor human tracking system that utilizes only commodity Wi-Fi devices. IndoTrack is composed of two innovative methods: (1) Doppler-MUSIC is able to extract accurate Doppler velocity information from noisy Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) samples; and (2) Doppler-AoA is able to determine the absolute trajectory of the target by jointly estimating target velocity and location via probabilistic co-modeling of spatial-temporal Doppler and AoA information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IndoTrack can achieve a 35cm median error in human trajectory estimation, outperforming the state-of-the-art systems and provide accurate location and velocity information for indoor human mobility and behavioral analysis.},

The temporal and spatial features are extracted by convolution of the video containing gesture. However, compared with the convolution calculation of a single image, multiframe image of dynamic gestures has more computation, more complex feature extraction, and more network parameters, which affects the recognition efficiency and real-time performance of the model. To solve above problems, a dynamic gesture recognition model based on CBAM-C3D is proposed. Key frame extraction technology, multimodal joint training, and network optimization with BN layer are used for making the network performance better. The experiments show that the recognition accuracy of the proposed 3D convolutional neural network combined with attention mechanism reaches 72.4\% on EgoGesture dataset, which is improved greatly compared with the current main dynamic gesture recognition methods, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified.},

  abstract = {Tracking human vital signs of breathing and heart rates during sleep is important as it can help to assess the general physical health of a person and provide useful clues for diagnosing possible diseases. Traditional approaches (e.g., Polysomnography (PSG)) are limited to clinic usage. Recent radio frequency (RF) based approaches require specialized devices or dedicated wireless sensors and are only able to track breathing rate. In this work, we propose to track the vital signs of both breathing rate and heart rate during sleep by using off-the-shelf WiFi without any wearable or dedicated devices. Our system re-uses existing WiFi network and exploits the fine-grained channel information to capture the minute movements caused by breathing and heart beats. Our system thus has the potential to be widely deployed and perform continuous long-term monitoring. The developed algorithm makes use of the channel information in both time and frequency domain to estimate breathing and heart rates, and it works well when either individual or two persons are in bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can accurately capture vital signs during sleep under realistic settings, and achieve comparable or even better performance comparing to traditional and existing approaches, which is a strong indication of providing non-invasive, continuous fine-grained vital signs monitoring without any additional cost.},

In this paper, we show that with off-the-shelf WiFi devices, fine-grained sleep information like a person's respiration, sleeping postures and rollovers can be successfully extracted. We do this by introducing Wi-Sleep, the first sleep monitoring system based on WiFi signals. Wi-Sleep adopts off-the-shelf WiFi devices to continuously collect the fine-grained wireless channel state information (CSI) around a person. From the CSI, Wi-Sleep extracts rhythmic patterns associated with respiration and abrupt changes due to the body movement. Compared to existing sleep monitoring systems that usually require special devices attached to human body (i.e. Probes, head belt, and wrist band), Wi-Sleep is completely contact less. In addition, different from many vision-based sleep monitoring systems, Wi-Sleep is robust to low-light environments and does not raise privacy concerns. Preliminary testing results show that the Wi-Sleep can reliably track a person's respiration and sleeping postures in different conditions.},

  abstract = {In this study, we present WindTalker, a novel and practical keystroke inference framework that allows an attacker to infer the sensitive keystrokes on a mobile device through WiFi-based side-channel information. WindTalker is motivated from the observation that keystrokes on mobile devices will lead to different hand coverage and the finger motions, which will introduce a unique interference to the multi-path signals and can be reflected by the channel state information (CSI). The adversary can exploit the strong correlation between the CSI fluctuation and the keystrokes to infer the user's number input. WindTalker presents a novel approach to collect the target's CSI data by deploying a public WiFi hotspot. Compared with the previous keystroke inference approach, WindTalker neither deploys external devices close to the target device nor compromises the target device. Instead, it utilizes the public WiFi to collect user's CSI data, which is easy-to-deploy and difficult-to-detect. In addition, it jointly analyzes the traffic and the CSI to launch the keystroke inference only for the sensitive period where password entering occurs. WindTalker can be launched without the requirement of visually seeing the smart phone user's input process, backside motion, or installing any malware on the tablet. We implemented Windtalker on several mobile phones and performed a detailed case study to evaluate the practicality of the password inference towards Alipay, the largest mobile payment platform in the world. The evaluation results show that the attacker can recover the key with a high successful rate.},

Researchers have exploited the characteristics of wireless signals to "hear" people's talk and "see" keystrokes by human users. Inspired by the excellent work of relevant scholars, we turn to explore the field of human-computer interaction using finger-grained gestures under WiFi environment. In this paper, we present Wi-Finger - the first solution using ubiquitous wireless signals to achieve number text input in WiFi devices. We implement a prototype of WiFinger on a commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure. Our scheme is based on the key intuition that while performing a certain gesture, the fingers of a user move in a unique formation and direction and thus generate a unique pattern in the time series of Channel State Information (CSI) values. WiFinger is deigned to recognize a set of finger-grained gestures, which are further used to realize continuous text input in off-the-shelf WiFi devices. As the results show, WiFinger achieves up to 90.4\% average classification accuracy for recognizing 9 digits finger-grained gestures from American Sign Language (ASL), and its average accuracy for single individual number text input in desktop reaches 82.67\% within 90 digits.},

The center-surround model proves to be useful for visual saliency detection. In this work, we explore using 3D FFT local spectra as features for saliency detection within the center-surround framework. We develop a spectral location based decomposition scheme to divide a 3D FFT cube into two components, one related to temporal changes and the other related to spatial changes. Temporal saliency and spatial saliency are detected separately using features derived from each spectral component through a simple center-surround comparison method. The two detection results are then combined to yield a saliency map. We apply the same detection algorithm to different color channels (YIQ) and incorporate the results into the final saliency determination. The proposed technique is tested with the public CRCNS database. Both visual and numerical evaluations verify the promising performance of our technique.},

  abstract = {Though deep neural networks have played a very important role in the field of vision-based hand gesture recognition, however, it is challenging to acquire large numbers of annotated samples to support its deep learning or training. Furthermore, in practical applications it often encounters some case with only one single sample for a new gesture class so that conventional recognition method cannot be qualified with a satisfactory classification performance. In this paper, the methodology of transfer learning is employed to build an effective network architecture of one-shot learning so as to deal with such intractable problem. Then some useful knowledge from deep training with big dataset of relative objects can be transferred and utilized to strengthen one-shot learning hand gesture recognition (OSLHGR) rather than to train a network from scratch. According to this idea a well-designed convolutional network architecture with deeper layers, C3D (Tran et al. in: ICCV, pp 4489\textendash 4497, 2015), is modified as an effective tool to extract spatiotemporal feature by deep learning. Then continuous fine-tune training is performed on a sample of new classes to complete one-shot learning. Moreover, the test of classification is carried out by Softmax classifier and geometrical classification based on Euclidean distance. Finally, a series of experiments and tests on two benchmark datasets, VIVA (Vision for Intelligent Vehicles and Applications) and SKIG (Sheffield Kinect Gesture) are conducted to demonstrate its state-of-the-art recognition accuracy of our proposed method. Meanwhile, a special dataset of gestures, BSG, is built using SoftKinetic DS325 for the test of OSLHGR, and a series of test results verify and validate its well classification performance and real-time response speed.},

The sensor suite fuses mechanomyography (MMG) and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to capture multi-modal (arm movement and hand gesture) command signals simultaneously. The IMU produces world referenced orientation and acceleration data while concomitant MMG tracks muscle activation through surface vibration. The use of surface muscle vibration for gesture recognition removes the need for electrical contact with the skin, which has impeded other forms of muscle measurement for gesture recognition in the field. This investigation presents hardware design, inertial recognition of arm movement, and the detailed structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) system used for real-time hand gesture recognition based on MMG signals. The system achieved 94\% accuracy for five gestures with simple calibration for each user, thereby providing an intuitive gesture based UAV control system. To our knowledge this is the first wearable system enabling multimodal control of UAVs through intuitive gestures that does not require electrical skin contact. Future work involves testing the system with larger UAV swarms.},

However, accurate recognition of hand gestures remains a substantial challenge that faces most of the recently existing recognition systems. In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNN) framework with multiple layers for accurate, effective, and less complex human hand gesture recognition has been proposed. Since the images of the infrared hand gestures can provide accurate gesture information through the low illumination environment, the proposed system is tested and evaluated on a database of hand-based near-infrared which including ten gesture poses. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed system provides excellent results of accuracy, precision, sensitivity (recall), and F1-score.

The motivation for experimenting with gesture interaction is justified by the personal and public domain prototype applications developed. The challenges related to developing user-dependent and independent gesture control are presented. In this article, we experiment with methods for user-dependent gesture recognition with a low number of training repetitions, and for feasible user-independent gesture recognition from a moderately large set of gestures. The user-dependent gesture recognition performance of the continuous Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is better when compared to discrete HMM with three gesture repetitions in a training set. With continuous HMM, a recognition accuracy level of 95\% is obtained with or without tilt normalization, while for discrete HMM a best recognition accuracy of 90\% is obtained. The user-independent gesture recognition performance with continuous HMM of 89\% is considerably better compared to tests with discrete HMM, when both are obtained with cross-validation from 2,520 gestures. An important result is that the effect of using tilt normalization notably increases the user-independent gesture recognition performance by 10- 15\% depending on the method used. The chosen methods show great potential for gesture-based interaction in multimedia applications.},

The study takes two of the most popular and arguably the best recognition methods currently in use - dynamic time warping and hidden Markov model - and sets them against a relatively novel approach founded on distance metric learning. The three selected algorithms are evaluated in terms of their overall performance, accuracy, training time, execution time and storage efficacy.

  abstract = {Hand Gesture Recognition sensor based on accelerometer and gyroscope is a sensor for capturing the positions of operator hand while controlling underwater remotely operated vehicle equipped with an arm. The proposed system has an advantage in its convenience by means of no training or exercise needed for operator before using it. The key issue here is how beginner operator could use easily the underwater remotely operated robot arm without any specific training. The conventional one uses a joystick for controlling the underwater system and it is inconvenience for beginner user as well as less precision. The proposed system consists of two main part: (1) ground station and (2) underwater remotely operated robot arm. This paper proposes the development of hand gesture recognition sensor used by operator at the ground station for controlling robot arm at the underwater robot. The proposed sensor uses accelerometers and gyroscopes installed in elbow, forearm, and wrist. These devices measure 3D position of each joints for constructing 3D position of hand. We design sensor's casing for its convenience of use by using CAD software. Each sensor is connected by Arduino Nano microcontroller having compact circuit and embedded it into sensor's casing. The sensors are connected to a microcontroller acting as master connected to microcontroller slave (sensor part). These sensors value are converted to 3D position by using forward kinematic. The forward kinematic values are sent to the underwater robot by using a wire utilizing Pulse Position Signal. Then, it converted again to servo's movement by using inverse kinematic. The result is operator able to control the underwater remotely robot arm by utilizing hand gesture directly. The last, operator could control the robot gripper based on flex sensor installed in operator's fingers. The accuracy of the sensor has been tested under laboratory condition, it has 98\% of accuracy.},

  abstract = {We propose SignFi to recognize sign language gestures using WiFi. SignFi uses Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi packets as the input and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the classification algorithm. Existing WiFi-based sign gesture recognition technologies are tested on no more than 25 gestures that only involve hand and/or finger gestures. SignFi is able to recognize 276 sign gestures, which involve the head, arm, hand, and finger gestures, with high accuracy. SignFi collects CSI measurements to capture wireless signal characteristics of sign gestures. Raw CSI measurements are pre-processed to remove noises and recover CSI changes over sub-carriers and sampling time. Pre-processed CSI measurements are fed to a 9-layer CNN for sign gesture classification. We collect CSI traces and evaluate SignFi in the lab and home environments. There are 8,280 gesture instances, 5,520 from the lab and 2,760 from the home, for 276 sign gestures in total. For 5-fold cross validation using CSI traces of one user, the average recognition accuracy of SignFi is 98.01\%, 98.91\%, and 94.81\% for the lab, home, and lab+home environment, respectively. We also run tests using CSI traces from 5 different users in the lab environment. The average recognition accuracy of SignFi is 86.66\% for 7,500 instances of 150 sign gestures performed by 5 different users.},

  abstract = {With the high demand for wireless data traffic, WiFi networks have experienced very rapid growth, because they provide high throughput and are easy to deploy. Recently, Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi networks is widely used for different sensing purposes. To get a better understanding of existing WiFi sensing technologies and future WiFi sensing trends, this survey gives a comprehensive review of the signal processing techniques, algorithms, applications, and performance results of WiFi sensing with CSI. Different WiFi sensing algorithms and signal processing techniques have their own advantages and limitations and are suitable for different WiFi sensing applications. The survey groups CSI-based WiFi sensing applications into three categories, detection, recognition, and estimation, depending on whether the outputs are binary/multi-class classifications or numerical values. With the development and deployment of new WiFi technologies, there will be more WiFi sensing opportunities wherein the targets may go beyond from humans to environments, animals, and objects. The survey highlights three challenges for WiFi sensing: robustness and generalization, privacy and security, and coexistence of WiFi sensing and networking. Finally, the survey presents three future WiFi sensing trends, i.e., integrating cross-layer network information, multi-device cooperation, and fusion of different sensors, for enhancing existing WiFi sensing capabilities and enabling new WiFi sensing opportunities.},

However, body motion and facial gestures play an essential role in sign language interaction. Taking this into account, we introduce an automatic sign language recognition system based on multiple gestures, including hands, body, and face. We used a depth camera (OAK-D) to obtain the 3D coordinates of the motions and recurrent neural networks for classification. We compare multiple model architectures based on recurrent networks such as Long Short-Term Memories (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and develop a noise-robust approach. For this work, we collected a dataset of 3000 samples from 30 different signs of the Mexican Sign Language (MSL) containing features coordinates from the face, body, and hands in 3D spatial coordinates. After extensive evaluation and ablation studies, our best model obtained an accuracy of 97\% on clean test data and 90\% on highly noisy data.},

The idea with this report is to present previous work in a structural manner using taxonomies at di erent levels. The report is structured in the following way. The rst chapter gives an introduction to new types of interfaces where one class is known as the "Looking at People" domain. Within this class computer vision-based human motion capture is de ned. In chapter two motion capture is described in a larger context describing the di erent sensors used for motion capture. Chapter three presents previous taxonomies which are commented and a new taxonomy is suggested. Chapter four describes a number of assumptions which are used in computer vision-based human motion capture. The next four chapters each give a detailed description of the four classes present in the taxonomy suggested in chapter three. Finally a conclusion is given in the last chapter. Throughout the descriptions of the taxonomy and its four classes a number of examples are given from the literature. Preface This technical report is the documentation of a survey within computer vision-based human motion capture. The writing of the report was carried out in the winter 98/99 while the reading of papers was done during the summer and fall of 1998. The work presented is the rst step in my Ph.D.study titled: "Multiple Cues for Model-Based Human Motion Capture". A large number of papers have been read to write this report. Approximately 2/3 of them (107) are directly concerned with computer vision-based human motion capture. Detailed summaries of these papers can be found in another concurrently written technical report: Summaries of 107 Computer Vision-Based HumanMotion Capture Papers [108].

A number of significant research advances are identified together with novel methodologies for automatic initialization, tracking, pose estimation and movement recognition. Recent research has addressed reliable tracking and pose estimation in natural scenes. Progress has also been made towards automatic understanding of human actions and behavior. This survey reviews recent trends in video based human capture and analysis, as well as discussing open problems for future research to achieve automatic visual analysis of human movement.},

The focus is on a general overview based on a taxonomy of system functionalities, broken down into four processes: initialization, tracking, pose estimation, and recognition. Each process is discussed and divided into subprocesses and/or categories of methods to provide a reference to describe and compare the more than 130 publications covered by the survey. References are included throughout the paper to exemplify important issues and their relations to the various methods. A number of general assumptions used in this research field are identified and the character of these assumptions indicates that the research field is still in an early stage of development. To evaluate the state of the art, the major application areas are identified and performances are analyzed in light of the methods presented in the survey.

  abstract = {Recent research on hand detection and gesture recognition has attracted increasing interest due to its broad range of potential applications, such as human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, hand action analysis, driver hand behavior monitoring, and virtual reality. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed with the aim of developing a robust algorithm which functions in complex and cluttered environments. Although several researchers have addressed this challenging problem, a robust system is still elusive. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based architecture to jointly detect and classify hand gestures. In the proposed architecture, the whole image is passed through a one-stage dense object detector to extract hand regions, which, in turn, pass through a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for hand gesture recognition. To evaluate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets for hand detection, including the Oxford, 5-signers, EgoHands, and Indian classical dance (ICD) datasets, along with two hand gesture datasets with different gesture vocabularies for hand gesture recognition, namely, the LaRED and TinyHands datasets. Here, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture is efficient and robust. In addition, it outperforms other approaches in both the hand detection and gesture classification tasks.},

On the other hand, the vision-based approach captures the movement of the singer's hand using a camera that is sometimes aided by making the signer wear a glove that has painted areas indicating the positions of the fingers or knuckles. The proposed system basically consists of a PowerGlove that is connected through the serial port to a workstation running the support vector machine algorithm.

Systems capable of recognizing sign-language symbols can be used for communication with the hearing-impaired. This paper represents the first attempt to recognize two-handed signs from the Unified Arabic Sign Language Dictionary using the CyberGlove and support vector machines (SVMs). 20 samples from each of 100 two-handed signs were collected from two adult signers. Because the signs are of different lengths, time division is used to standardize sign length. The duration of every sign is divided into a specific number of segments, and the mean and standard deviation of each segment are used to represent the signal in the segment. After pre-processing, principal component analysis is used for feature extraction. For recognition, a SVM is trained on 15 samples from each sign. The performance is obtained by testing the trained SVM on the remaining five samples from each sign. A recognition rate of 99.6\% on the testing data is obtained.},

Such devices typically use machine-learning models, either locally or externally, for gesture classification. However, most devices with local processing cannot offer training and updating of the machine-learning model during use, resulting in suboptimal performance under practical conditions. Here we report a wearable surface electromyography biosensing system that is based on a screen-printed, conformal electrode array and has in-sensor adaptive learning capabilities. Our system implements a neuro-inspired hyperdimensional computing algorithm locally for real-time gesture classification, as well as model training and updating under variable conditions such as different arm positions and sensor replacement. The system can classify 13 hand gestures with 97.12\% accuracy for two participants when training with a single trial per gesture. A high accuracy (92.87\%) is preserved on expanding to 21 gestures, and accuracy is recovered by 9.5\% by implementing model updates in response to varying conditions, without additional computation on an external device. A surface electromyography biosensing system that is based on a screen-printed, conformal electrode array and has in-sensor adaptive learning capabilities can classify human gestures in real time and with high accuracy.},

We naturally use various gestures to express our own intentions in everyday life. Hand gesture is one of the important methods of non-verbal communication for human beings for its freer in movements and much more expressive than any other body parts. Hand gesture recognition has a number of potential applications in human-computer interaction, machine vision, virtual reality, machine control in industry, and so on. As a gesture is a continuous motion on a sequential time series, the HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) must be a prominent recognition tool. The most important thing in hand gesture recognition is what the input features are that best represent the characteristics of the moving hand gesture.This paper presents part of literature review on ongoing research and findings on different technique and approaches in gesture recognition using HMMs for vision-based approach.},

A good concept hereby allows to intuitively switch the interaction context on demand by using different hand gestures. The recognition of various, possibly complex hand gestures, however, introduces unintentional overhead to the system. Consequently, we present a data glove prototype comprising a glove-embedded gesture classifier utilizing data from Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in the fingertips. In an extensive set of experiments with 57 participants, our system was tested with 22 hand gestures, all taken from the French Sign Language (LSF) alphabet. Results show that our system is capable of detecting the LSF alphabet with a mean accuracy score of 92\% and an F1 score of 91\%, using complementary filter with a gyroscope-to-accelerometer ratio of 93\%. Our approach has also been compared to the local fusion algorithm on an IMU motion sensor, showing faster settling times and less delays after gesture changes. Real-time performance of the recognition is shown to occur within 63 milliseconds, allowing fluent use of the gestures via Bluetooth-connected systems.},

Gesture Keyboard tracks the user's fingers and recognizes finger motions to judge keys input in the horizontal direction. Real-Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting), a machine learning technique, uses HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradients) features in an image of the user's hands to estimate keys in the depth direction. Each virtual key follows a corresponding finger, so it is possible to input characters at the user's preferred hand position even if the user displaces his hands while inputting data. Additionally, because Gesture Keyboard requires only one camera, keyboard-less devices can implement this system easily. We show the effectiveness of utilizing a machine learning technique for estimating depth.},

  abstract = {Hand gesture has been part of human communication, where, young children usually communicate by using gesture before they can talk. Adults may have to also gesture if they need to or they are indeed mute or deaf. Thus the idea of teaching a machine to also learn gestures is very appealing due to its unique mode of communications. A reliable hand gesture recognition system will make the remote control become obsolete. However, many of the new techniques proposed are complicated to be implemented in real time, especially as a human machine interface.  This thesis focuses on recognizing hand gesture in static posture. Since static hand postures not only can express some concepts, but also can act as special transition states in temporal gestures recognition, thus estimating static hand postures is in fact a big topics in gesture recognition. A database consists of 200 gesture images have been built, where five volunteers had help in the making of the database. The images were captured in a controlled environment and the postures are free from occlusion where the background is uncluttered and the hand is assumed to have been localized.    A system was then built to recognize the hand gesture. The captured image will be first preprocessed in order to binarize the palm region, where Sobel edge detection technique has been employed, with later followed by morphological operation. A new feature extraction technique has been developed, based on horizontal and vertical states transition count, and the ratio of hand area with respect to the whole area of image. These set of features have been proven to have high intra class dissimilarity attributes.    In order to have a system that can be easily trained, artificial neural networks has been chosen in the classification stage. A multilayer perceptron with back-propagation algorithm has been developed, thus the system is actually in-built to be used as a human machine interface. The gesture recognition system has been built and tested in Matlab, where simulations have shown promising results. The performance of recognition rate in this research is 95\% which shows a major improvement in comparison to the available methods.},

The booked is concluded with a chapter on robust parameter designs. This book covers a broad range of topics for regular factorial designs and presents all of the material in very mathematical fashion. However, the authors do a wonderful job of keeping the statistical methodology at the forefront of the book and the mathematical detail is presented as the necessary tool to study these designs. The book will serve as a great text for an advanced graduate level course in design theory for students with the necessary mathematical background. The book will surely become an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students doing research in the design of factorial experiments. In addition, practitioners will also find the book useful for the comprehensive collection of optimal designs presented at the end of many chapters.

Research has shown that five parameters are required to recognize any sign language gesture: hand shape, location, orientation and motion, as well as facial expressions. Using a single parameter can cause conflicts in recognition of signs that are similarly signed. This paper pioneers research at the group towards combining multiple parameters to better distinguish between similar signs. This eventually aims to enable the recognition of a large SASL vocabulary. The proposed methodology combines hand location and hand shape recognition into one combined recognition system. The recognition approach is applied to 12 SASL signs that consist of six pairs of signs with the same hand shape performed at two different locations. It is shown that the approach is able to achieve a high average recognition accuracy of 79\% across all signs and distinguish between the signs effectively. It is also shown to be robust to variations in test subjects.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Most industrial robots are still programmed using the typical teaching process, through the use of the robot teach pendant. This is a tedious and time-consuming task that requires some technical expertise, and hence new approaches to robot programming are required. The purpose of this paper is to present a robotic system that allows users to instruct and program a robot with a high-level of abstraction from the robot language.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The paper presents in detail a robotic system that allows users, especially non-expert programmers, to instruct and program a robot just showing it what it should do, in an intuitive way. This is done using the two most natural human interfaces (gestures and speech), a force control system and several code generation techniques. Special attention will be given to the recognition of gestures, where the data extracted from a motion sensor (three-axis accelerometer) embedded in the Wii remote controller was used to capture human hand behaviours. Gestures (dynamic hand positions) as well as manual postures (static hand positions) are recognized using a statistical approach and artificial neural networks.                                         Findings               It is shown that the robotic system presented is suitable to enable users without programming expertise to rapidly create robot programs. The experimental tests showed that the developed system can be customized for different users and robotic platforms.                                         Research limitations/implications               The proposed system is tested on two different robotic platforms. Since the options adopted are mainly based on standards, it can be implemented with other robot controllers without significant changes. Future work will focus on improving the recognition rate of gestures and continuous gesture recognition.                                         Practical implications               The key contribution of this paper is that it offers a practical method to program robots by means of gestures and speech, improving work efficiency and saving time.                                         Originality/value               This paper presents an alternative to the typical robot teaching process, extending the concept of human-robot interaction and co-worker scenario. Since most companies do not have engineering resources to make changes or add new functionalities to their robotic manufacturing systems, this system constitutes a major advantage for small- to medium-sized enterprises.},

We treat this as an optimization problem, seeking for the hand model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between the appearance and 3D structure of hypothesized instances of a hand model and actual hand observations. This optimization problem is effectively solved using a variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed method does not require special markers and/or a complex image acquisition setup. Being model based, it provides continuous solutions to the problem of tracking hand articulations. Extensive experiments with a prototype GPU-based implementation of the proposed method demonstrate that accurate and robust 3D tracking of hand articulations can be achieved in near real-time (15Hz).},

  abstract = {Research in automatic analysis of sign language has largely focused on recognizing the lexical (or citation) form of sign gestures as they appear in continuous signing, and developing algorithms that scale well to large vocabularies. However, successful recognition of lexical signs is not sufficient for a full understanding of sign language communication. Nonmanual signals and grammatical processes which result in systematic variations in sign appearance are integral aspects of this communication but have received comparatively little attention in the literature. In this survey, we examine data acquisition, feature extraction and classification methods employed for the analysis of sign language gestures. These are discussed with respect to issues such as modeling transitions between signs in continuous signing, modeling inflectional processes, signer independence, and adaptation. We further examine works that attempt to analyze nonmanual signals and discuss issues related to integrating these with (hand) sign gestures. We also discuss the overall progress toward a true test of sign recognition systems--dealing with natural signing by native signers. We suggest some future directions for this research and also point to contributions it can make to other fields of research. Web-based supplemental materials (appendicies) which contain several illustrative examples and videos of signing can be found at www.computer.org/publications/dlib.},

Research papers based on hand gestures have adopted many different techniques, including those based on instrumented sensor technology and computer vision. In other words, the hand sign can be classified under many headings, such as posture and gesture, as well as dynamic and static, or a hybrid of the two. This paper focuses on a review of the literature on hand gesture techniques and introduces their merits and limitations under different circumstances. In addition, it tabulates the performance of these methods, focusing on computer vision techniques that deal with the similarity and difference points, technique of hand segmentation used, classification algorithms and drawbacks, number and types of gestures, dataset used, detection range (distance) and type of camera used. This paper is a thorough general overview of hand gesture methods with a brief discussion of some possible applications.},

  abstract = {With intelligent big data, a variety of gesture-based recognition systems have been developed to enable intuitive interaction by utilizing machine learning algorithms. Realizing a high gesture recognition accuracy is crucial, and current systems learn extensive gestures in advance to augment their recognition accuracies. However, the process of accurately recognizing gestures relies on identifying and editing numerous gestures collected from the actual end users of the system. This final end-user learning component remains troublesome for most existing gesture recognition systems. This paper proposes a method that facilitates end-user gesture learning and recognition by improving the editing process applied on intelligent big data, which is collected through end-user gestures. The proposed method realizes the recognition of more complex and precise gestures by merging gestures collected from multiple sensors and processing them as a single gesture. To evaluate the proposed method, it was used in a shadow puppet performance that could interact with on-screen animations. An average gesture recognition rate of 90\% was achieved in the experimental evaluation, demonstrating the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed method for editing visualized learning gestures.},

It uses hand motion analysis to segment hand motion data from a WIMU device that incorporates magnetic, angular rate, and gravity sensors (MARG) and a sensor fusion algorithm to automatically distinguish segments that represent handwriting from nonhandwriting data in continuous hand motion data. Dynamic time warping (DTW) recognition algorithm is used to recognize handwriting in real-time. We demonstrate that a user can freely write in air using an intuitive WIMU as an input and hand motion analysis device to recognize the handwriting in 3D space. The experimental results for recognizing handwriting in free space show that the proposed method is effective and efficient for other natural interaction techniques, such as in computer games and real-time hand gesture recognition applications.},

In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. This has motivated a very active research area concerned with computer vision-based analysis and interpretation of hand gestures. We survey the literature on visual interpretation of hand gestures in the context of its role in HCI. This discussion is organized on the basis of the method used for modeling, analyzing, and recognizing gestures. Important differences in the gesture interpretation approaches arise depending on whether a 3Dmodel of the human hand or an image appearancemodel of the human hand is used. 3D hand models offer a way of more elaborate modeling of hand gestures but lead to computational hurdles that have not been overcome given the real-time requirements of HCI. Appearance-based models lead to computationally efficient ``purposive'' approaches that work well under constrained situations but seem to lack the generality desirable for HCI. We also discuss implemented gestural systems as well as other potential applications of vision-based gesture recognition. Although the current progress is encouraging, further theoretical as well as computational advances are needed before gestures can be widely used for HCI. We discuss directions of future research in gesture recognition, including its integration with other natural modes of humancomputer interaction},

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight.

The 2D image positions of the centers of the head and both hands of the user are used as features; these are located by a color-based tracking method. From training data of a given gesture, we first learn the spatial information and then group the data into segments that are automatically aligned temporally. The temporal information is further integrated to build a finite state machine (FSM) recognizer. Each gesture has a FSM corresponding to it. The computational efficiency of the FSM recognizers allows us to achieve real-time on-line performance. We apply this technique to build an experimental system that plays a game of "Simon Says" with the user.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, hand gestures are becoming one of the most natural and intuitive ways of communication between human and computer. To this end, a complex process including hand gesture acquisition, hand detection, gesture representation and recognition must be carried out. This paper presents a method that detects hand and segments hand regions from images captured by a Kinect sensor. As Kinect sensor provides not only RGB images as conventional camera, but also depth and skeleton, in our work, we incorporate multi-modal data from Kinect to deal with hand detection and segmentation. Specifically, we use skeleton to approximately determine hand palm. Then a skin based detector will be applied to discard non-skin pixels from the region of interest. Using depth data helps to limit the human body regions and remove false positive regions from the previous steps. Finally, morphological operations will be applied to fill holes in the hand region. The main advantage of this method is very easy to implement and it performs in real-time on an ordinary computer. We evaluate the proposed method on a dataset of hand gestures captured from different viewpoints. Experiment shows that it provides reasonable accuracy at very high frame rate. It also produces comparable performance in comparison with deep learning based methods.},

  abstract = {Gesture is a natural expression form for humans, but its recognition is a similarly hard problem as speech recognition. In this paper, I present a real-time hand gesture recognition system, which identifies relevant parts in the continous sensor data stream, and classifies them to the most probable gesture. Instead of the usual button-based segmentation, I have created an automatic segmentation method, which makes the interface more natural. The results showed that the two different classifiers reach 97.4\% and 96\% accuracy on a personalized gesture set, and these results can be improved for certain gesture sets with the combination of the two algorithms. Furthermore, the system has great performance and low response time, so the user experience is much better than with previous gesture recognizers.},

  abstract = {Human Computer Interaction is geared towards seamless human machine integration without the need for LCDs, Keyboards or Gloves. Systems have already been developed to react to limited hand gestures especially in gaming and in consumer electronics control. Yet, it is a monumental task in bridging the well-developed sign languages in different parts of the world with a machine to interpret the meaning. One reason is the sheer extent of the vocabulary used in sign language and the sequence of gestures needed to communicate different words and phrases. Auslan the Australian Sign Language is comprised of numbers, finger spelling for words used in common practice and a medical dictionary. There are 7415 words listed in Auslan website. This research article tries to implement recognition of numerals using a computer using the static hand gesture recognition system developed for consumer electronics control at the University of Wollongong in Australia. The experimental results indicate that the numbers, zero to nine can be accurately recognized with occasional errors in few gestures. The system can be further enhanced to include larger numerals using a dynamic gesture recognition system.},

Further, it achieves this goal without requiring instrumentation of the human body with sensing devices. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype of WiSee using USRP-N210s and evaluate it in both an office environment and a two- bedroom apartment.

  abstract = {This paper presents Widar2.0, the first WiFi-based system that enables passive human localization and tracking using a single link on commodity off-the-shelf devices. Previous works based on either specialized or commercial hardware all require multiple links, preventing their wide adoption in scenarios like homes where typically only one single AP is installed. The key insight underlying Widar2.0 to circumvent the use of multiple links is to leverage multi-dimensional signal parameters from one single link. To this end, we build a unified model accounting for Angle-of-Arrival, Time-of-Flight, and Doppler shifts together and devise an efficient algorithm for their joint estimation. We then design a pipeline to translate the erroneous raw parameters into precise locations, which first finds parameters corresponding to the reflections of interests, then refines range estimates, and ultimately outputs target locations. Our implementation and evaluation on commodity WiFi devices demonstrate that Widar2.0 achieves better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art localization systems, which either use specialized hardwares or require 2 to 40 Wi-Fi links.},

  abstract = {Various pioneering approaches have been proposed for Wi-Fi-based sensing, which usually employ learning-based techniques to seek appropriate statistical features, yet do not support precise tracking without prior training. Thus to advance passive sensing, the ability to track fine-grained human mobility information acts as a key enabler. In this paper, we propose Widar, a Wi-Fi-based tracking system that simultaneously estimates a human's moving velocity (both speed and direction) and location at a decimeter level. Instead of applying statistical learning techniques, Widar builds a theoretical model that geometrically quantifies the relationships between CSI dynamics and the user's location and velocity. On this basis, we propose novel techniques to identify frequency components related to human motion from noisy CSI readings and then derive a user's location in addition to velocity. We implement Widar on commercial Wi-Fi devices and validate its performance in real environments. Our results show that Widar achieves decimeter-level accuracy, with a median location error of 25 cm given initial positions and 38 cm without them and a median relative velocity error of 13\%.},

  abstract = {Touch-free guided hand gesture recognition for human-robot interactions plays an increasingly significant role in teleoperated surgical robot systems. Indeed, despite depth cameras provide more practical information for recognition accuracy enhancement, the instability and computational burden of depth data represent a tricky problem. In this letter, we propose a novel multi-sensor guided hand gesture recognition system for surgical robot teleoperation. A multi-sensor data fusion model is designed for performing interference in the presence of occlusions. A multilayer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) consisting of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module and a dropout layer (LSTM-RNN) is proposed for multiple hand gestures classification. Detected hand gestures are used to perform a set of human-robot collaboration tasks on a surgical robot platform. Classification performance and prediction time is compared among the LSTM-RNN model and several traditional Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, such as k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Results show that the proposed LSTM-RNN classifier is able to achieve a higher recognition rate and faster inference speed. In addition, the present adaptive data fusion system shows a strong anti-interference capability for hand gesture recognition in real-time.},

In these gestures hand poses can undergo motion and discrete changes. However, continuous deformations of the hand shapes are not permitted. We have developed a recognition engine which can reliably recognize these gestures despite individual variations. The engine also has the ability to detect start and end of gesture sequences in an automated fashion. The recognition strategy uses a combination of static shape recognition (performed using contour discriminant analysis), Kalman filter based hand tracking and a HMM based temporal characterization scheme. The system is fairly robust to background clutter and uses skin color for static shape recognition and tracking. A real time implementation on standard hardware is developed. Experimental results establish the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract = {As computers become more pervasive in society, facilitating natural human\textendash computer interaction (HCI) will have a positive impact on their use. Hence, there has been growing interest in the development of new approaches and technologies for bridging the human\textendash computer barrier. The ultimate aim is to bring HCI to a regime where interactions with computers will be as natural as an interaction between humans, and to this end, incorporating gestures in HCI is an important research area. Gestures have long been considered as an interaction technique that can potentially deliver more natural, creative and intuitive methods for communicating with our computers. This paper provides an analysis of comparative surveys done in this area. The use of hand gestures as a natural interface serves as a motivating force for research in gesture taxonomies, its representations and recognition techniques, software platforms and frameworks which is discussed briefly in this paper. It focuses on the three main phases of hand gesture recognition i.e. detection, tracking and recognition. Different application which employs hand gestures for efficient interaction has been discussed under core and advanced application domains. This paper also provides an analysis of existing literature related to gesture recognition systems for human computer interaction by categorizing it under different key parameters. It further discusses the advances that are needed to further improvise the present hand gesture recognition systems for future perspective that can be widely used for efficient human computer interaction. The main goal of this survey is to provide researchers in the field of gesture based HCI with a summary of progress achieved to date and to help identify areas where further research is needed.},

  abstract = {Hand gesture based Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) is one of the most natural and intuitive ways to communicate between people and machines, since it closely mimics how human interact with each other. In this demo, we present a hand gesture recognition system with Kinect sensor, which operates robustly in uncontrolled environments and is insensitive to hand variations and distortions. Our system consists of two major modules, namely, hand detection and gesture recognition. Different from traditional vision-based hand gesture recognition methods that use color-markers for hand detection, our system uses both the depth and color information from Kinect sensor to detect the hand shape, which ensures the robustness in cluttered environments. Besides, to guarantee its robustness to input variations or the distortions caused by the low resolution of Kinect sensor, we apply a novel shape distance metric called Finger-Earth Mover's Distance (FEMD) for hand gesture recognition. Consequently, our system operates accurately and efficiently. In this demo, we demonstrate the performance of our system in two real-life applications, arithmetic computation and rock-paper-scissors game.},

The recognition is based on global motion features, extracted from each difference image of the image sequence. The system uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as statistical classifier. These HMMs are trained on a database of 24 isolated gestures, performed by 14 different people.

Although these feature extraction methods can be used for a wide variety of image sequence processing applications, the target application presented in this paper is gesture recognition. The novel feature extraction methods have been integrated into an HMM-based gesture recognition system and led to substantial improvements for this system. It turned out that the new features are not only able to describe the gesture characteristics much better than the old features, but additionally they also led to a dramatic reduction in dimensionality of the feature vector used for representing each frame of the image sequence. This resulted in the fact that it was possible to use the novel features in combination with a new architecture for statistical image sequence recognition. The result of this investigation is a high performance gesture recognition system with significantly improved recognition rates and real-time capabilities.},

  abstract = {Hand gesture recognition is one of the most effective modes of interaction between humans and computers due to being highly flexible and user-friendly. A real-time hand gesture recognition system should aim to develop a user-independent interface with high recognition performance. Nowadays, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show high recognition rates in image classification problems. Due to the unavailability of large labeled image samples in static hand gesture images, it is a challenging task to train deep CNN networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16 and ResNet from scratch. Therefore, inspired by CNN performance, an end-to-end fine-tuning method of a pre-trained CNN model with score-level fusion technique is proposed here to recognize hand gestures in a dataset with a low number of gesture images. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOO CV) and regular CV tests on two benchmark datasets. A real-time American sign language (ASL) recognition system is developed and tested using the proposed technique.},

The glove has various new features, including the measurement of forearm roll position, that are not found in other glove input devices described in the literature. The glove contains a number of flexible, plastic bands whose displacement, during joint rotation, is measured using linear potentiometers. The new glove is light, compact, easy to wear and use, robust, and inexpensive, and is intended for use in teleoperation applications in conjunction with a remotely located robot hand/wrist. Another property is that it can be easily adjusted to fit a wide range of human hand sizes. Preliminary testing of the glove has shown that it can achieve an accuracy in position measurement that compares well to that of a number of commercially-produced gloves that are presently in use.

New emerging interaction technologies allow developing and experimenting with new interaction methods on the long way to providing intuitive human computer interaction. In this paper, we aim at recognizing gestures to interact with an application and present the design and evaluation of our sensor-based gesture recognition. As input device we employ the Wii-controller (Wiimote) which recently gained much attention world wide. We use the Wiimote's acceleration sensor independent of the gaming console for gesture recognition. The system allows the training of arbitrary gestures by users which can then be recalled for interacting with systems like photo browsing on a home TV. The developed library exploits Wii-sensor data and employs a hidden Markov model for training and recognizing user-chosen gestures. Our evaluation shows that we can already recognize gestures with a small number of training samples. In addition to the gesture recognition we also present our experiences with the Wii-controller and the implementation of the gesture recognition. The system forms the basis for our ongoing work on multimodal intuitive media browsing and are available to other researchers in the field.},

The proof of the 'ideal' picture is not being able to discern object from representation - to be convinced that one is looking at the real thing. At best, this judgement is usually based on a first order evaluation of 'ease of identification'; i.e. realistic pictures should resemble what they represent. But resemblance is only part of the effect. In summing up prevailing theories on realism in images, Perkins comments: " Pictures inform by packaging information in light in essentially the same form that real objects and scenes package it, and the perceiver unwraps that package in essentially the same way."

  abstract = {Sign language is important since it provides a way for us to the deaf culture and more opportunities to communicate with those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Since sign language chiefly uses body languages to convey meaning, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) techniques can be used to recognize them for some sign language translation applications. In this paper, we show for the first time that Wi-Fi signals can be used to recognize sign language. The key intuition is that different hand and arm motions introduce different multi-path distortions in Wi-Fi signals and generate different unique patterns in the time-series of Channel State Information (CSI). More specifically, we propose a Wi-Fi signal-based sign language recognition system called WiSign. Different from existing Wi-Fi signal-based human activity recognition systems, WiSign uses 3 Wi-Fi devices to improve the recognition performance. We implemented the WiSign using a TP-Link TL-WR1043ND Wi-Fi router and two Lenovo X100e laptops. The evaluation results show that our system can achieve a mean prediction accuracy of 93.8\% and mean false positive of 1.55\%.},

Sign language is the art of conveying messages using hand gestures. Recognition of dynamic hand gestures in American Sign Language (ASL) became a very important challenge that is still unresolved. In order to resolve the challenges of dynamic ASL recognition, a more advanced successor of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) called 3-D CNNs is employed, which can recognize the patterns in volumetric data like videos. The CNN is trained for classification of 100 words on Boston ASL (Lexicon Video Dataset) LVD dataset with more than 3300 English words signed by 6 different signers. 70\% of the dataset is used for Training while the remaining 30\% dataset is used for testing the model. The proposed work outperforms the existing state-of-art models in terms of precision (3.7\%), recall (4.3\%), and f-measure (3.9\%). The computing time (0.19 seconds per frame) of the proposed work shows that the proposal may be used in real-time applications.},

Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, which will be studied separately later on. This paper reviews why using ANNs in particular is better suited for analyzing human},

  abstract = {Recent advances in various signal processing technologies, coupled with an explosion in the available computing power, have given rise to a number of novel human-computer interaction (HCI) modalities: speech, vision-based gesture recognition, eye tracking, electroencephalograph, etc. Successful embodiment of these modalities into an interface has the potential of easing the HCI bottleneck that has become noticeable with the advances in computing and communication. It has also become increasingly evident that the difficulties encountered in the analysis and interpretation of individual sensing modalities may be overcome by integrating them into a multimodal human-computer interface. We examine several promising directions toward achieving multimodal HCI. We consider some of the emerging novel input modalities for HCI and the fundamental issues in integrating them at various levels, from early signal level to intermediate feature level to late decision level. We discuss the different computational approaches that may be applied at the different levels of modality integration. We also briefly review several demonstrated multimodal HCI systems and applications. Despite all the recent developments, it is clear that further research is needed for interpreting and fitting multiple sensing modalities in the context of HCI. This research can benefit from many disparate fields of study that increase our understanding of the different human communication modalities and their potential role in HCI.},

  abstract = {With the popularization of Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, passive action recognition on channel state information (CSI) has attracted much attention. Most conventional work under the machine-learning framework utilizes handcrafted features (e.g., statistic features) that are unable to sufficiently describe the sequence data and heavily rely on designers' experiences. Therefore, how to automatically learn abundant spatial\textendash temporal information from CSI data is a topic worthy of study. In this article, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates spatial features learned from the convolutional neural network (CNN) into the temporal model multilayer bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Specifically, CSI streams are segmented into a series of patches, from which spatial features are extracted by our designed CNN structure. Considering long-term dependencies between adjacent sequences, the fully connected layer of CNN for each patch is taken as the Bi-LSTM sequential input to further capture temporal features. Our model is appealing in that it can simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore deep spatial\textendash temporal features for CSI-based action recognition. Furthermore, in order to solve the problem that the trained model fully fails with environmental changes, we use the off-the-shelf model as the pretrained model and fine-tune it in the new scenario. The transfer method is able to realize cross-scene action recognition with low computational consumption and satisfactory accuracy. We carry out experiments on indoor data and the experimental results validate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

They play an indispensable role in our lives and makes people convenient to communicate, pay, socialize, etc. However, they also bring a lot of security and privacy risks. Keystroke operations of numeric keypad are often required when users input password to perform mobile payment or input other privacy-sensitive information. Different keystrokes may cause different finger movements that will bring different interference to WiFi signal, which may be reflected by channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we propose WiPass, a password-keystroke recognition system for numerical keypad input on smartphones, which especially occurs frequently in mobile payment APPs. Based on only a public WiFi hotspot deployed in the victim payment scenario, WiPass would extracts and analyzes the CSI data generated by the password-keystroke operation of the smartphone user, and infers the user's payment password by comparing the CSI waveforms of different keystrokes. We implemented the WiPass system by using COTS WiFi AP devices and smartphones. The average keystroke segmentation accuracy was 80.45\%, and the average keystroke recognition accuracy was 74.24\%.},

  abstract = {This dissertation examines whole-hand input: the full and direct use of the hand's capabilities for the control of computer-mediated tasks. It presents the subject as a distinct study, independent of specific application or interface device. It includes a comprehensive discussion of the ideas, issues, and technologies relevant to the field. Whole-hand input is a powerful tool for the real-time control of complex computer-mediated tasks that require the manipulation and coordination of many degrees of freedom. By taking advantage of the innate naturalness, adaptability, and dexterity of the hand, whole-hand input techniques can provide performance superior to that of conventional devices (such as dials, mice, and joysticks) when applied to complex tasks.The important problems of whole-hand input involve appropriateness of use, control design, and device selection. The dissertation addresses these with a design method for whole-hand input by which an interface designer can discuss, develop, and evaluate techniques and devices for using whole-hand input in a particular application. Three experiments illustrate use of the design method and validate the principles of the thesis.A testbed and software library for investigating whole-hand input techniques is described. The testbed allows easy development and testing of whole-hand input with application simulations. The library is based on an abstract whole-hand input device type providing a standard interface to different physical whole-hand input devices. It features techniques for device calibration, posture recognition, and gesture recognition.Three prototype applications using the testbed, and one musical performance application demonstrate a variety of whole-hand input techniques including master-slave control, controlling task variables with hand shape, and gestural command input.The text concludes with detailed recommendations for future work to forward the understanding of the direct use of the hand as an input device.An accompanying videotape demonstrates the three experiments, the prototype applications, and shows a short section of the musical performance.

The survey is organized around a novel model of the hand gesture recognition process. In the reviewed literature, 13 methods were found for hand localization and 11 were found for gesture classification. 24 of the papers included real-world applications to test a gesture recognition system, but only 8 application categories were found (and three applications accounted for 18 of the papers). The papers that use the Kinect and the OpenNI libraries for hand tracking tend to focus more on applications than on localization and classification methods, and show that the OpenNI hand tracking method is good enough for the applications tested thus far. However, the limitations of the Kinect and other depth sensors for gesture recognition have yet to be tested in challenging applications and environments.},

While prior solutions require the user to hold a wireless transmitter, or require custom wireless hardware, or can only determine a pre-defined set of hand gestures, this paper introduces WiDraw, the first hand motion tracking system using commodity WiFi cards, and without any user wearables. WiDraw harnesses the Angle-of-Arrival values of incoming wireless signals at the mobile device to track the user's hand trajectory. We utilize the intuition that whenever the user's hand occludes a signal coming from a certain direction, the signal strength of the angle representing the same direction will experience a drop. Our software prototype using commodity wireless cards can track the user's hand with a median error lower than 5 cm. We use WiDraw to implement an in-air handwriting application that allows the user to draw letters, words, and sentences, and achieves a mean word recognition accuracy of 91\%.},

To do so, we have implemented a considerable number of systems, and will release all software and evaluation code. We summarize important conclusions here: (1) Pose estimation appears roughly solved for scenes with isolated hands. However, methods still struggle to analyze cluttered scenes where hands may be interacting with nearby objects and surfaces. To spur further progress we introduce a challenging new dataset with diverse, cluttered scenes. (2) Many methods evaluate themselves with disparate criteria, making comparisons difficult. We define a consistent evaluation criteria, rigorously motivated by human experiments. (3) We introduce a simple nearest-neighbor baseline that outperforms most existing systems. This implies that most systems do not generalize beyond their training sets. This also reinforces the under-appreciated point that training data is as important as the model itself. We conclude with directions for future progress.},

First , huma.n performance in adjusting a random dot stereogram depth is measured to determine the possibility of pointing at a 3-D object. This experiment shows that the image displayed on the field sequential stereoscopic display can give enough depth information to its user who inputs 3-D coordinate with a mouse. Next, user performance in pointing at 3-D objects using a mouse as an input device is measured . The target for 3-D pointing and an arrow shaped 3-D cursor are in the form of wire frames and displayed stereoscopically. Finally, user performance using a 3-D magnetic tracking input device is tested. These experiments show that it is possible to point at a 3-D object on a field sequential stereoscopic display with relatively high accuracy. However, pointing at objects in depth takes much more time than pointing at objects in a plane. When a mouse is used , the required pointing time heavily depends on the direction of pointing. This tendency is due to the difficulties of depth detection using the field sequential stereoscopic display, and of manipulating a 3-D cursor with a 2-D input device. For the task tested, the 3-D magnetic tracking device was better in terms of the task completion time and error rate.},

  abstract = {Gesture recognition has become increasingly important in human-computer interaction (HCI) and can support a broad array of emerging applications, such as smart home, virtual reality, and mobile gaming. Traditional approaches usually rely on dedicated sensors that are worn by the user or cameras that require line of sight. In this paper, we present fine-grained finger gesture recognition by using a single commodity WiFi device without requiring user to wear any sensors. Our low-cost system, WiFinger, takes advantages of the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) available from commodity WiFi devices and the prevalence of WiFi network infrastructures. It senses and identifies subtle movements of finger gestures by examining the unique patterns exhibited in the detailed CSI. In WiFigner, we devise environmental noise removal mechanism to mitigate the effect of signal dynamic due to the environment changes. Moreover, we propose to capture the intrinsic gesture behavior to deal with individual diversity and gesture inconsistency. Our experimental evaluation in both home and office environments demonstrates that our system can achieve over 93\% recognition accuracy and is robust to both environment changes and individual diversity. Results also show that our system can work with WiFi beacon signals and provides accurate gesture recognition under NLOS scenarios.},

  abstract = {: Recognition of dynamic hand gestures in real-time is a difficult task because the system can never know when or from where the gesture starts and ends in a video stream. Many researchers have been working on vision-based gesture recognition due to its various applications. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture based on the combination of a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The proposed architecture extracts spatial-temporal information from video sequences input while avoiding extensive computation. The 3D-CNN is used for the extraction of spectral and spatial features which are then given to the LSTM network through which classification is carried out. The proposed model is a light-weight architecture with only 3.7 million training parameters. The model has been evaluated on 15 classes from the 20BN-jester dataset available publicly. The model was trained on 2000 video-clips per class which were separated into 80\% training and 20\% validation sets. An accuracy of 99\% and 97\% was achieved on training and testing data, respectively. We further show that the combination of 3D-CNN with LSTM gives superior results as compared to MobileNetv2 + LSTM.},

  abstract = {Hand gesture recognition systems (HGR) based on electromyography signals (EMGs) and inertial measurement unit signals (IMUs) have been studied for different applications in recent years. Most commonly, cutting-edge HGR methods are based on supervised machine learning methods. However, the potential benefits of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have shown that these techniques could be a viable option for classifying EMGs. Methods based on RL have several advantages such as promising classification performance and online learning from experience. In this work, we developed an HGR system made up of the following stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, and post-processing. For the classification stage, we built an RL-based agent capable of learning to classify and recognize eleven hand gestures\textemdash five static and six dynamic\textemdash using a deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm based on EMG and IMU information. The proposed system uses a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) for the representation of the agent policy. We carried out the same experiments with two different types of sensors to compare their performance, which are the Myo armband sensor and the G-force sensor. We performed experiments using training, validation, and test set distributions, and the results were evaluated for user-specific HGR models. The final accuracy results demonstrated that the best model was able to reach up to 97.50\%{$\pm$}1.13\% and 88.15\%{$\pm$}2.84\% for the classification and recognition, respectively, with regard to static gestures, and 98.95\%{$\pm$}0.62\% and 90.47\%{$\pm$}4.57\% for the classification and recognition, respectively, with regard to dynamic gestures with the Myo armband sensor. The results obtained in this work demonstrated that RL methods such as the DQN are capable of learning a policy from online experience to classify and recognize static and dynamic gestures using EMG and IMU signals.},

The key enabler underlying Chronos is a novel algorithm that can compute sub-nanosecond time-of-flight using commodity WiFi cards. By multiplying the time-of-flight with the speed of light, a MIMO access point computes the distance between each of its antennas and the client, hence localizing it. Our implementation on commodity WiFi cards demonstrates that Chronos's accuracy is comparable to state-of-the-art localization systems, which use four or five access points.},

  abstract = {WiFi based gesture recognition systems have recently proliferated due to the ubiquitous availability of WiFi in almost every modern building. The key limitation of existing WiFi based gesture recognition systems is that they require the user to be in the same configuration (i.e., at the same position and in same orientation) when performing gestures at runtime as when providing training samples, which significantly restricts their practical usability. In this paper, we propose a WiFi based gesture recognition system, namely WiAG, which recognizes the gestures of the user irrespective of his/her configuration. The key idea behind WiAG is that it first requests the user to provide training samples for all gestures in only one configuration and then automatically generates virtual samples for all gestures in all possible configurations by applying our novel translation function on the training samples. Next, for each configuration, it generates a classification model using virtual samples corresponding to that configuration. To recognize gestures of a user at runtime, as soon as the user performs a gesture, WiAG first automatically estimates the configuration of the user and then evaluates the gesture against the classification model corresponding to that estimated configuration. Our evaluation results show that when user's configuration is not the same at runtime as at the time of providing training samples, WiAG significantly improves the gesture recognition accuracy from just 51.4\% to 91.4\%.},

Among various approaches, one shot learning approach is advantageous because it requires minimum amount of data. Here, we provide a thorough review about one-shot learning gesture recognition from RGB-D data and propose a novel spatiotemporal feature extracted from RGB-D data, namely mixed features around sparse keypoints (MFSK). In the review, we analyze the challenges that we are facing, and point out some future research directions which may enlighten researchers in this field. The proposed MFSK feature is robust and invariant to scale, rotation and partial occlusions. To alleviate the insufficiency of one shot training samples, we augment the training samples by artificially synthesizing versions of various temporal scales, which is beneficial for coping with gestures performed at varying speed. We evaluate the proposed method on the Chalearn gesture dataset (CGD). The results show that our approach outperforms all currently published approaches on the challenging data of CGD, such as translated, scaled and occluded subsets. When applied to the RGB-D datasets that are not one-shot (e.g., the Cornell Activity Dataset-60 and MSR Daily Activity 3D dataset), the proposed feature also produces very promising results under leave-one-out cross validation or one-shot learning.},

It examines channel features and can uniquely identify both in-place activities and walking movements across a home by comparing them against signal profiles. Signal profiles construction can be semi-supervised and the profiles can be adaptively updated to accommodate the movement of the mobile devices and day-to-day signal calibration. Our experimental evaluation in two apartments of different size demonstrates that our approach can achieve over 96\% average true positive rate and less than 1\% average false positive rate to distinguish a set of in-place and walking activities with only a single WiFi access point. Our prototype also shows that our system can work with wider signal band (802.11ac) with even higher accuracy.},

  abstract = {Local space-time features have recently become a popular video representation for action recognition. Several methods for feature localization and description have been proposed in the literature and promising recognition results were demonstrated for a number of action classes. The comparison of existing methods, however, is often limited given the different experimental settings used. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare previously proposed space-time features in a common experimental setup. In particular, we consider four different feature detectors and six local feature descriptors and use a standard bag-of-features SVM approach for action recognition. We investigate the performance of these methods on a total of 25 action classes distributed over three datasets with varying difficulty. Among interesting conclusions, we demonstrate that regular sampling of space-time features consistently outperforms all tested space-time interest point detectors for human actions in realistic settings. We also demonstrate a consistent ranking for the majority of methods over different datasets and discuss their advantages and limitations.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose WifiU, which uses commercial WiFi devices to capture fine-grained gait patterns to recognize humans. The intuition is that due to the differences in gaits of different people, the WiFi signal reflected by a walking human generates unique variations in the Channel State Information (CSI) on the WiFi receiver. To profile human movement using CSI, we use signal processing techniques to generate spectrograms from CSI measurements so that the resulting spectrograms are similar to those generated by specifically designed Doppler radars. To extract features from spectrograms that best characterize the walking pattern, we perform autocorrelation on the torso reflection to remove imperfection in spectrograms. We evaluated WifiU on a dataset with 2,800 gait instances collected from 50 human subjects walking in a room with an area of 50 square meters. Experimental results show that WifiU achieves top-1, top-2, and top-3 recognition accuracies of 79.28\%, 89.52\%, and 93.05\%, respectively.},

However, is it always possible to sense human respiration no matter where the subject stays and faces? What affects human respiration sensing and what's the theory behind? In this paper, we first introduce the Fresnel model in free space, then verify the Fresnel model for WiFi radio propagation in indoor environment. Leveraging the Fresnel model and WiFi radio propagation properties derived, we investigate the impact of human respiration on the receiving RF signals and develop the theory to relate one's breathing depth, location and orientation to the detectability of respiration. With the developed theory, not only when and why human respiration is detectable using WiFi devices become clear, it also sheds lights on understanding the physical limit and foundation of WiFi-based sensing systems. Intensive evaluations validate the developed theory and case studies demonstrate how to apply the theory to the respiration monitoring system design.},

  abstract = {WiFi-based contactless sensing has found numerous applications in the fields of smart home and health care owning to its low-cost, non-intrusive and privacy-preserving characteristics. While promising in many aspects, the limited sensing range and interference issues still exist, hindering the adoption of WiFi sensing in real world. In this paper, inspired by the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) metric in communication theory, we propose a new metric named SSNR (sensing-signal-to-noise-ratio) to quantify the sensing capability of WiFi systems. We theoretically model the effect of transmitter-receiver distance on sensing coverage. We show that in LoS scenario, the sensing coverage area increases first from a small oval to a maximal one and then decreases. When the transmitter-receiver distance further increases, the coverage area is separated into two ovals located around the two transceivers respectively. We demonstrate that, instead of applying complex signal processing scheme or advanced hardware, by just properly placing the transmitter and receiver, the two well-known issues in WiFi sensing (i.e., small range and severe interference) can be greatly mitigated. Specifically, by properly placing the transmitter and receiver, the coverage of human walking sensing can be expanded by around 200\%. By increasing the transmitter-receiver distance, a target's fine-grained respiration can still be accurately sensed with one interferer sitting just 0.5 m away.},

RT-Fall exploits the phase and amplitude of the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) accessible in commodity WiFi devices, and for the first time fulfills the goal of segmenting and detecting the falls automatically in real-time, which allows users to perform daily activities naturally and continuously without wearing any devices on the body. This work makes two key technical contributions. First, we find that the CSI phase difference over two antennas is a more sensitive base signal than amplitude for activity recognition, which can enable very reliable segmentation of fall and fall-like activities. Second, we discover the sharp power profile decline pattern of the fall in the time-frequency domain and further exploit the insight for new feature extraction and accurate fall segmentation/detection. Experimental results in four indoor scenarios demonstrate that RT-fall consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach WiFall with 14~percent higher sensitivity and 10~percent higher specificity on average.},

To simplify the system, a unique mapping between the traffic police gestures and the orientation and movement of hands is defined. The hand motion characters are extracted by fixing a 3-axis accelerometer on the back of each hand. A 2level hierarchical classifier is used to recognize the gestures. First the gestures are categorized into three groups, according to the movement of each hand. Then a gesture is recognized by comparing it with the predefined templates. This real-time recognition algorithm is implemented by a micro-controller. It is envisaged that this will help drivers.},

Their key limitation lies in the lack of a model that can quantitatively correlate CSI dynamics and human activities. In this paper, we propose CARM, a CSI based human Activity Recognition and Monitoring system. CARM has two theoretical underpinnings: a CSI-speed model, which quantifies the correlation between CSI value dynamics and human movement speeds, and a CSI-activity model, which quantifies the correlation between the movement speeds of different human body parts and a specific human activity. By these two models, we quantitatively build the correlation between CSI value dynamics and a specific human activity. CARM uses this correlation as the profiling mechanism and recognizes a given activity by matching it to the best-fit profile. We implemented CARM using commercial WiFi devices and evaluated it in several different environments. Our results show that CARM achieves an average accuracy of greater than 96\%.},

We present WiHear, which enables Wi-Fi signals to ``hear'' our talks without deploying any devices. To achieve this, WiHear needs to detect and analyze fine-grained radio reflections from mouth movements. WiHear solves this micro-movement detection problem by introducing Mouth Motion Profile that leverages partial multipath effects and wavelet packet transformation. Since Wi-Fi signals do not require line-of-sight, WiHear can ``hear'' people talks within the radio range. Further, WiHear can simultaneously ``hear'' multiple people's talks leveraging MIMO technology. We implement WiHear on both USRP N210 platform and commercial Wi-Fi infrastructure. Results show that within our pre-defined vocabulary, WiHear can achieve detection accuracy of 91 percent on average for single individual speaking no more than six words and up to 74 percent for no more than three people talking simultaneously. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further improved by deploying multiple receivers from different angles.},

Fall, which is one of the major health threats and obstacles to independent living of elders, will aggravate the global pressure in elders' health care and injury rescue. Thus, automatic fall detection is highly in need. Current proposed fall detection systems either need hardware installation or disrupt people's daily life. These limitations make it hard to widely deploy fall detection systems in residential settings. In this work, we analyze the wireless signal propagation model considering human activities influence. We then propose a novel and truly unobtrusive detection method based on the advanced wireless technologies, which we call as WiFall. WiFall employs the time variability and special diversity of Channel State Information (CSI) as the indicator of human activities. As CSI is readily available in prevalent in-use wireless infrastructures, WiFall withdraws the need for hardware modification, environmental setup and worn or taken devices. We implement WiFall on laptops equipped with commercial 802.11n NICs. Two typical indoor scenarios and several layout schemes are examined. As demonstrated by the experimental results, WiFall yielded 87\% detection precision with false alarm rate of 18\% in average.},

  abstract = {The rapid progress of Internet of things (IoT) technology raises an imperative demand on human machine interfaces (HMIs) which provide a critical linkage between human and machines. Using a glove as an intuitive and low-cost HMI can expediently track the motions of human fingers, resulting in a straightforward communication media of human\textendash machine interactions. When combining several triboelectric textile sensors and proper machine learning technique, it has great potential to realize complex gesture recognition with the minimalist-designed glove for the comprehensive control in both real and virtual space. However, humidity or sweat may negatively affect the triboelectric output as well as the textile itself. Hence, in this work, a facile carbon nanotubes/thermoplastic elastomer (CNTs/TPE) coating approach is investigated in detail to achieve superhydrophobicity of the triboelectric textile for performance improvement. With great energy harvesting and human motion sensing capabilities, the glove using the superhydrophobic textile realizes a low-cost and self-powered interface for gesture recognition. By leveraging machine learning technology, various gesture recognition tasks are done in real time by using gestures to achieve highly accurate virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) controls including gun shooting, baseball pitching, and flower arrangement, with minimized effect from sweat during operation.},

  abstract = {The human hand is a complex biological system able to perform numerous tasks with impressive accuracy and dexterity. Gestures furthermore play an important role in our daily interactions, and humans are particularly skilled at perceiving and interpreting detailed signals in communications. Creating believable hand motions for virtual characters is an important and challenging task. Many new methods have been proposed in the Computer Graphics community within the last years, and significant progress has been made towards creating convincing, detailed hand and finger motions. This state of the art report presents a review of the research in the area of hand and finger modeling and animation. Starting with the biological structure of the hand and its implications for how the hand moves, we discuss current methods in motion capturing hands, data-driven and physics-based algorithms to synthesize their motions, and techniques to make the appearance of the hand model surface more realistic. We then focus on areas in which detailed hand motions are crucial such as manipulation and communication. Our report concludes by describing emerging trends and applications for virtual hand animation.},

Part II (Chapters 5 through 14) deals with the theory of three-layer series-coupled perceptrons, on which most work has been done to date. Part III (Chapters 15 through 20) deals with the theory of multi-layer and cross-coupled perceptrons. Part IV is concerned with more speculative models and problems for future analysis. Of necessity, the final chapters become increasingly heuristic in character, as the theory of perceptrons is not yet complete, and new possibilities are continually coming to light.},

  abstract = {A method for the representation, recognition, and interpretation of parameterized gesture is presented. By parameterized gesture we mean gestures that exhibit a systematic spatial variation; one example is a point gesture where the relevant parameter is the two-dimensional direction. Our approach is to extend the standard hidden Markov model method of gesture recognition by including a global parametric variation in the output probabilities of the HMM states. Using a linear model of dependence, we formulate an expectation-maximization (EM) method for training the parametric HMM. During testing, a similar EM algorithm simultaneously maximizes the output likelihood of the PHMM for the given sequence and estimates the quantifying parameters. Using visually derived and directly measured three-dimensional hand position measurements as input, we present results that demonstrate the recognition superiority of the PHMM over standard HMM techniques, as well as greater robustness in parameter estimation with respect to noise in the input features. Finally, we extend the PHMM to handle arbitrary smooth (nonlinear) dependencies. The nonlinear formulation requires the use of a generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm for both training and the simultaneous recognition of the gesture and estimation of the value of the parameter. We present results on a pointing gesture, where the nonlinear approach permits the natural spherical coordinate parameterization of pointing direction.},

  abstract = {Gesture recognition technology enables machines to understand human gestures. The technology is considered as a key enabler for gaming and virtual reality applications. In this paper, we propose an effective, low-cost capacitive sensor device to recognize hand gestures. In particular, we designed a prototype of a wearable capacitive sensor unit to capture the capacitance values from the electrodes placed on finger phalanges. The sensor captures finger capacitance values. Each gesture has specific finger capacitance values. We applied a running median filter to the output of the sensor and extracted 15 features for gesture classification training and testing tasks. Subsequently, various analyses were performed to provide more insights into the sensing data. We applied and compared two machine learning algorithms: Error Correction Output Code Support Vector Machines (ECOC-SVM) and \$\{K\}\$ -Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifiers. The training and testing recognition rates were observed for both intra-participant and inter-participant data sets. Further, we introduced a feature compression approach derived from correlation analysis to reduce the complexity of the machine learning algorithms. Using cross validation, we achieved a classification rate of approximately 99\% for intra-participant data. We achieved a lower recognition rate of 97\% (average cross validation testing) for compressed feature data set using both machine learning approaches. For the inter-participant data, the recognition rate was 99\% (normalized feature data) using KNN and 97\% using ECOC-SVM. The research findings show that our recognition system is competitive and has an immense potential for further study.},

A semi-supervised hierarchical dynamic framework based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed for simultaneous gesture segmentation and recognition where skeleton joint information, depth and RGB images, are the multimodal input observations. Unlike most traditional approaches that rely on the construction of complex handcrafted features, our approach learns high-level spatiotemporal representations using deep neural networks suited to the input modality: a Gaussian-Bernouilli Deep Belief Network (DBN) to handle skeletal dynamics, and a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) to manage and fuse batches of depth and RGB images. This is achieved through the modeling and learning of the emission probabilities of the HMM required to infer the gesture sequence. This purely data driven approach achieves a Jaccard index score of 0.81 in the ChaLearn LAP gesture spotting challenge. The performance is on par with a variety of state-of-the-art hand-tuned feature-based approaches and other learning-based methods, therefore opening the door to the use of deep learning techniques in order to further explore multimodal time series data.},

  abstract = {Gesture-based interaction, as a natural way for human-computer interaction, has a wide range of applications in ubiquitous computing environment. This paper presents an acceleration-based gesture recognition approach, called FDSVM ( Frame-based Descriptor and multi-class SVM), which needs only a wearable 3-dimensional accelerometer. With FDSVM, firstly, the acceleration data of a gesture is collected and represented by a frame-based descriptor, to extract the discriminative information. Then a SVM-based multi-class gesture classifier is built for recognition in the nonlinear gesture feature space. Extensive experimental results on a data set with 3360 gesture samples of 12 gestures over weeks demonstrate that the proposed FDSVM approach significantly outperforms other four methods: DTW, Naive Bayes, C4.5 and HMM. In the user-dependent case, FDSVM achieves the recognition rate of 99.38\% for the 4 direction gestures and 95.21\% for all the 12 gestures. In the user-independent case, it obtains the recognition rate of 98.93\% for 4 gestures and 89.29\% for 12 gestures. Compared to other accelerometer-based gesture recognition approaches reported in literature FDSVM gives the best resulrs for both user-dependent and user-independent cases.},

  abstract = {Non-invasive human sensing based on radio signals has attracted a great deal of research interest and fostered a broad range of innovative applications of localization, gesture recognition, smart health-care, etc., for which a primary primitive is to detect human presence. Previous works have studied the detection of moving humans via signal variations caused by human movements. For stationary people, however, existing approaches often employ a prerequisite scenario-tailored calibration of channel profile in human-free environments. Based on in-depth understanding of human motion induced signal attenuation reflected by PHY layer channel state information (CSI), we propose DeMan, a unified scheme for non-invasive detection of moving and stationary human on commodity WiFi devices. DeMan takes advantage of both amplitude and phase information of CSI to detect moving targets. In addition, DeMan considers human breathing as an intrinsic indicator of stationary human presence and adopts sophisticated mechanisms to detect particular signal patterns caused by minute chest motions, which could be destroyed by significant whole-body motion or hidden by environmental noises. By doing this, DeMan is capable of simultaneously detecting moving and stationary people with only a small number of prior measurements for model parameter determination, yet without the cumbersome scenario-specific calibration. Extensive experimental evaluation in typical indoor environments validates the great performance of DeMan in various human poses and locations and diverse channel conditions. Particularly, DeMan provides a detection rate of around 95\% for both moving and stationary people, while identifies human-free scenarios by 96\%, all of which outperforms existing methods by about 30\%.},

  abstract = {WiFi-based device-free motion tracking systems track persons without requiring them to carry any device. Existing work has explored signal parameters such as time-of-flight (ToF), angle-of-arrival (AoA), and Doppler-frequency-shift (DFS) extracted from WiFi channel state information (CSI) to locate and track people in a room. However, they are not robust due to unreliable estimation of signal parameters. ToF and AoA estimations are not accurate for current standards-compliant WiFi devices that typically have only two antennas and limited channel bandwidth. On the other hand, DFS can be extracted relatively easily on current devices but is susceptible to the high noise level and random phase offset in CSI measurement, which results in a speed-sign-ambiguity problem and renders ambiguous walking speeds. This paper proposes WiTraj, a device-free indoor motion tracking system using commodity WiFi devices. WiTraj improves tracking robustness from three aspects: 1) It significantly improves DFS estimation quality by using the ratio of the CSI from two antennas of each receiver, 2) To better track human walking, it leverages multiple receivers placed at different viewing angles to capture human walking and then intelligently combines the best views to achieve a robust trajectory reconstruction, and, 3) It differentiates walking from in-place activities, which are typically interleaved in daily life, so that non-walking activities do not cause tracking errors. Experiments show that WiTraj can significantly improve tracking accuracy in typical environments compared to existing DFS-based systems.

Defining an appropriate risk threshold to recommend intervention is a key challenge in bringing a risk prediction model to clinical application; such risk thresholds are often defined in an ad hoc way. This is problematic because tacitly assumed costs of false positive and false negative classifications may not be clinically sensible. For example, when choosing the risk threshold that maximizes the proportion of patients correctly classified, false positives and false negatives are assumed equally costly. Furthermore, small to moderate sample sizes may lead to unstable optimal thresholds, which requires a particularly cautious interpretation of results.},

With 5 gesture classes, 1 training example for each class, and 30 test examples for each class, our classifier achieves 96\% accuracy. With 5 training examples per class, the classifier achieves 98\% accuracy, which is greater than the 10-example accuracy of other efforts using HMM's[1, 2].

  abstract = {Smartwatch is becoming one of the most popular wearable device with many major smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung and Apple releasing their smartwatches recently. Apart from the fitness applications, the smartwatch provides a rich user interface that has enabled many applications like instant messaging and email. Since the smartwatch is worn on the wrist, it introduces a unique opportunity to understand user's arm, hand and possibly finger movements using its accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Although user's arm and hand gestures are likely to be identified with ease using the smartwatch sensors, it is not clear how much of user's finger gestures can be recognized. In this paper, we show that motion energy measured at the smartwatch is sufficient to uniquely identify user's hand and finger gestures. We identify essential features of accelerometer and gyroscope data that reflect the movements of tendons (passing through the wrist) when performing a finger or a hand gesture. With these features, we build a classifier that can uniquely identify 37 (13 finger, 14 hand and 10 arm) gestures with an accuracy of 98\textbackslash\%. We further extend our gesture recognition to identify the characters written by the user with her index finger on a surface, and show that such finger-writing can also be accurately recognized with nearly 95\% accuracy. Our presented results will enable many novel applications like remote control and finger-writing-based input to devices using smartwatch.},

Additionally, the recognition of 40 CSL sentences is implemented to evaluate our framework for continuous SLR. For gesture-based control, a real-time interactive system is built as a virtual Rubik's cube game using 18 kinds of hand gestures as control commands. While ten subjects play the game, the performance is also examined in user-specific and user-independent classification.

It is a feature-based bottom-up approach that is characterized by its learning capability and time-scale invariability. To apply HMMs, one set of time-sequential images is transformed into an image feature vector sequence, and the sequence is converted into a symbol sequence by vector quantization. In learning human action categories, the parameters of the HMMs, one per category, are optimized so as to best describe the training sequences from the category. To recognize an observed sequence, the HMM which best matches the sequence is chosen. Experimental results for real time-sequential images of sports scenes show recognition rates higher than 90\%. The recognition rate is improved by increasing the number of people used to generate the training data, indicating the possibility of establishing a person-independent action recognizer.{$<<$}ETX{$>>$}},

In this paper, we introduce an HMM-based method to recognize complex single hand gestures. Gesture images are gained by a common web camera. Skin color is used to segment hand area from the image to form a hand image sequence. Then we put forward a state-based spotting algorithm to split continuous gestures. After that, feature extraction is executed on each gesture. Features used in the system contain hand position, velocity, size, and shape. We raise a data aligning algorithm to align feature vector sequences for training. Then an HMM is trained alone for each gesture. The recognition results demonstrate that our methods are effective and accurate.},

We propose a novel vision-based system for automatic interpretation of a limited set of dynamic hand gestures. This involves extracting the temporal signature of the hand motion from the performed gesture. The concept of motion energy is used to estimate the dominant motion from an image sequence. To achieve the desired result, we introduce the concept of modeling the dynamic hand gesture using a "nite state machine.

Many hand gesture recognition methods using visual analysis have been proposed: syntactical analysis, neural networks, the hidden Markov model (HMM). In our research, an HMM is proposed for various types of hand gesture recognition. In the preprocessing stage, this approach consists of three different procedures for hand localization, hand tracking and gesture spotting. The hand location procedure detects hand candidate regions on the basis of skin-color and motion. The hand tracking algorithm finds the centroids of the moving hand regions, connects them, and produces a hand trajectory. The gesture spotting algorithm divides the trajectory into real and meaningless segments. To construct a feature database, this approach uses a combined and weighted location, angle and velocity feature codes, and employs a k-means clustering algorithm for the HMM codebook. In our experiments, 2400 trained gestures and 2400 untrained gestures are used for training and testing, respectively. Those experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields a satisfactory and higher recognition rate for user images of different hand size, shape and skew angle.},

The movement of the human body parts cause changes in the wireless signal reflections, which result in variations in the CSI. By analyzing the data streams of CSIs for different activities and comparing them against stored models, human behavior can be recognized. This is done by extracting features from CSI data streams and using machine learning techniques to build models and classifiers. The techniques from the literature that are presented herein have great performance; however, instead of the machine learning techniques employed in these works, we propose to use deep learning techniques such as long-short term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networking (RNN) and show the improved performance. We also discuss different challenges such as environment change, frame rate selection, and the multi-user scenario; and finally suggest possible directions for future work.},

While many valuable efforts have been made, it still lacks efficient ways to capture fine grain hand gesture as well as track data of long distance dependency in complex gesture. In this paper, we firstly design a novel data glove with two arm rings and a specially integrated three-dimensional flex sensor to capture fine grain motion from full arm and all knuckles. Secondly, an improved deep feature fusion network is proposed to detect long distance dependency in complex hand gestures. In order to track detailed motion features, a convolutional neural network based feature fusion strategy is given to fuse data from multi-sensors by extracting both shallow and deep features. Moreover, a residual module is introduced to avoid over fitting and gradient vanishing during deepening the neural network. Thirdly, a long short term memory (LSTM) model with fused feature vector as input is introduced to classify complex hand motions into corresponding categories. Results of comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our work performs better than related algorithms, especially in America sign language (with the precise of 99.93\%) and Chinese sign language (with the precise of 96.1\%).},

  abstract = {In recent years, research efforts seeking to provide more natural, human-centered means of interacting with computers have gained growing interest. A particularly important direction is that of perceptive user interfaces, where the computer is endowed with perceptive capabilities that allow it to acquire both implicit and explicit information about the user and the environment. Vision has the potential of carrying a wealth of information in a non-intrusive manner and at a low cost, therefore it constitutes a very attractive sensing modality for developing perceptive user interfaces. Proposed approaches for vision-driven interactive user interfaces resort to technologies such as head tracking, face and facial expression recognition, eye tracking and gesture recognition. In this paper, we focus our attention to vision-based recognition of hand gestures.

Understanding shopper's behavior through physical analytics can provide crucial insights to the business owner in terms of effectiveness of promotions, arrangement of products and efficiency of services. However, analyzing shopper's behavior and browsing patterns is challenging. Since video surveillance can not used due to high cost and privacy concerns, it is necessary to design novel techniques that can provide accurate and efficient view of shopper's behavior. In this work, we propose WiFi-based sensing of shopper's behavior in a retail store. Specifically, we show that various states of a shopper such as standing near the entrance to view a promotion or walking quickly to proceed towards the intended item can be accurately classified by profiling Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi. We recognize a few representative states of shopper's behavior at the entrance and inside the store, and show how CSI-based profile can be used to detect that a shopper is in one of the states with very high accuracy ({$\approx$} 90\%). We discuss the potential and limitations of CSI-based sensing of shopper's behavior and physical analytics in general.},

  abstract = {The past few years have witnessed the great potential of exploiting channel state information retrieved from commodity WiFi devices for respiration monitoring. However, existing approaches only work when the target is close to the WiFi transceivers and the performance degrades significantly when the target is far away. On the other hand, most home environments only have one WiFi access point and it may not be located in the same room as the target. This sensing range constraint greatly limits the application of the proposed approaches in real life.             This paper presents FarSense--the first real-time system that can reliably monitor human respiration when the target is far away from the WiFi transceiver pair. FarSense works well even when one of the transceivers is located in another room, moving a big step towards real-life deployment. We propose two novel schemes to achieve this goal: (1) Instead of applying the raw CSI readings of individual antenna for sensing, we employ the ratio of CSI readings from two antennas, whose noise is mostly canceled out by the division operation to significantly increase the sensing range; (2) The division operation further enables us to utilize the phase information which is not usable with one single antenna for sensing. The orthogonal amplitude and phase are elaborately combined to address the "blind spots" issue and further increase the sensing range. Extensive experiments show that FarSense is able to accurately monitor human respiration even when the target is 8 meters away from the transceiver pair, increasing the sensing range by more than 100\%.1 We believe this is the first system to enable through-wall respiration sensing with commodity WiFi devices and the proposed method could also benefit other sensing applications.},

  abstract = {There has been a growing interest in equipping the objects and environment surrounding the user with sensing capabilities. Smart indoor spaces such as smart homes and offices can implement the sensing and processing functionality, relieving users from the need of wearing or carrying smart devices. Enabling such smart spaces requires device-free effortless sensing of user's identity and activities. Device-free sensing using WiFi has shown great potential in such scenarios, however, fundamental questions such as person identification have remained unsolved. In this paper, we present WiWho, a framework that can identify a person from a small group of people in a device-free manner using WiFi. We show that Channel State Information (CSI) used in recent WiFi can identify a person's steps and walking gait. The walking gait being distinguishing characteristics for different people, WiWho uses CSI-based gait for person identification. We demonstrate how step and walk analysis can be used to identify a person's walking gait from CSI, and how this information can be used to identify a person. WiWho does not require a person to carry any device and is effortless since it only requires the person to walk for a few steps (e.g. entering a home or an office). We evaluate WiWho using experiments at multiple locations with a total of 20 volunteers, and show that it can identify a person with average accuracy of 92\% to 80\% from a group of 2 to 6 people. We also show that in most cases walking as few as 2-3 meters is sufficient to recognize a person's gait and identify the person. We discuss the potential and challenges of WiFi- based person identification with respect to smart space applications.},

However, in the gesture recognition community, it lacks of suitable datasets for developing egocentric (first-person view) gesture recognition methods, in particular in the deep learning era. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark dataset named EgoGesture with sufficient size, variation, and reality to be able to train deep neural networks. This dataset contains more than 24~000 gesture samples and 3~000~000 frames for both color and depth modalities from 50 distinct subjects. We design 83 different static and dynamic gestures focused on interaction with wearable devices and collect them from six diverse indoor and outdoor scenes, respectively, with variation in background and illumination. We also consider the scenario when people perform gestures while they are walking. The performances of several representative approaches are systematically evaluated on two tasks: gesture classification in segmented data and gesture spotting and recognition in continuous data. Our empirical study also provides an in-depth analysis on input modality selection and domain adaptation between different scenes.},

  abstract = {Dynamic gesture recognition, which plays an essential role in human-computer interaction, has been widely investigated but not yet fully addressed. The challenge mainly lies in three folders: 1) to model both of the spatial appearance and the temporal evolution simultaneously; 2) to address the interference from the varied and complex background; 3) the requirement of real-time processing. In this paper, we address the above challenges by proposing a novel deep deformable 3D convolutional neural network for end-to-end learning, which not only gains impressive accuracy in challenging datasets but also can meet the requirement of the real-time processing. We propose three types of very deep 3D CNNs for gesture recognition, which can directly model the spatiotemporal information with their inherent hierarchical structure. To eliminate the background interference, a light-weight spatiotemporal deformable convolutional module is specially designed to augment the spatiotemporal sampling locations of the 3D convolution by learning additional offsets according to the preceding feature map. It can not only diversify the shape of the convolution kernel to better fit the appearance of the hands and arms, but also help the models pay more attention to the discriminative frames in the video sequence. The proposed method is evaluated on three challenging datasets, EgoGesture, Jester and Chalearn-IsoGD, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all of them. Our model ranked first on Jester's official leader-board until the submission time. The code and the trained models are released for better communication and future works.},

We envision this technology to find applications in finger-gesture control, disabled-friendly devices, physical therapy etc. The requirements of mm-level sensitivity and user-friendly feature using existing WiFi signals pose great challenges. Here, we present Mudra, a fine-grained finger gesture recognition system which leverages WiFi signals to enable a near-human-to-machine interaction with finger motion. Mudra uses a two-antenna receiver to detect and recognize finger gesture. It uses the signals received from one antenna to cancel the signal from the other. This "cancellation" is extremely sensitive to and enables us detect small variation in channel due to finger movements. Since Mudra decodes gestures with existing WiFi transmissions, Mudra enables gesture recognition without sacrificing WiFi transmission opportunities. Besides, Mudra is user-friendly with no need of user training. To demonstrate Mudra, we implement prototype on the NI-based SDR platform and use COTS WiFi adapter. We evaluate Mudra in a typical office environment. The results show that our system can achieve 96\% accuracy.},

A feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) is founded and trained by the training dataset. A test method is used in which the gesture will be recognized when recognized label times reach the threshold of activation times by the ANN classifier. In the experiment, we collected real sEMG data from twelve subjects and used a set of five gestures from each subject to evaluate our model, with an average recognition rate of 98.7\% and an average response time of 227.76 ms, which is only one-third of the gesture time. Therefore, the pattern recognition system might be able to recognize a gesture before the gesture is completed.},

Currently, the inherent complexity of human physical activities makes it difficult to accurately recognize gestures with wearable sensors, especially in real time. To this end, a real-time hand gesture recognition system is presented in this paper. In particular, sliding window technology and y-axis threshold are used to detect intended gestures from a continuous data stream and then the segmented data are classified by applying a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. After noise is removed, six-axis sensor data from wrist-worn devices are fed into the model without requiring feature engineering. We use twelve common hand gestures to evaluate the performance of our model. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed system with an accuracy of 99.8\% on average. Our approach allows for an accurate and nonindividual hand gesture recognition. It holds potential to be integrated into a smart watch or other wearable devices for intuitive human computer interaction.},

In the first module, techniques of robust hands detection, background subtraction and pupils detection are efficiently combined to precisely extract the feature information with the aid of simple colored gloves in the unconstrained environment. Meanwhile, an effective and efficient hierarchical feature description scheme with different scale features to characterize sign language is proposed, where principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to characterize the finger features more elaborately. In the second part, a Tied-Mixture Density Hidden Markov Models (TMDHMM) framework for SLR is proposed, which can speed up the recognition without the significant loss of recognition accuracy compared with the continuous hidden Markov models (CHMM). Experimental results based on 439 frequently used Chinese sign language (CSL) words show that the proposed methods can work well for the medium vocabulary SLR in the environment without special constraints and the recognition accuracy is up to 92.5\%.},

  abstract = {With the development of signal processing technology, the ubiquitous Wi-Fi devices open an unprecedented opportunity to solve the challenging human gesture recognition problem by learning motion representations from wireless signals. Wi-Fi-based gesture recognition systems, although yield good performance on specific data domains, are still practically difficult to be used without explicit adaptation efforts to new domains. Various pioneering approaches have been proposed to resolve this contradiction but extra training efforts are still necessary for either data collection or model re-training when new data domains appear. To advance cross-domain recognition and achieve fully zero-effort recognition, we propose Widar3.0, a Wi-Fi-based zero-effort cross-domain gesture recognition system. The key insight of Widar3.0 is to derive and extract domain-independent features of human gestures at the lower signal level, which represent unique kinetic characteristics of gestures and are irrespective of domains. On this basis, we develop a one-fits-all general model that requires only one-time training but can adapt to different data domains. Experiments on various domain factors (i.e. environments, locations, and orientations of persons) demonstrate the accuracy of 92.7\% for in-domain recognition and 82.6\%-92.4\% for cross-domain recognition without model re-training, outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions.},

The recognition is done through two phases: the skeleton phase concerning capturing and processing skeleton feature of the hand gesture, and the hand phase focusing on extracting hand contour feature of the hand gesture. Experimental results confirm an overall 94\% accuracy in recognizing and matching the pre-defined templates and robustness to backgrounds.},
