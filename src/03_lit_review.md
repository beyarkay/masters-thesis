TODO:
- This lacks the alpha that some tikz diagrams will provide



TODO: should also note that the vast majority of glove-based gesture
recognition is very dumb "arm movements" and very little is as dexterous as
Ergo


TODO: Include some plot about the fidelity of the glove-based systems

Notes from Trienko meeting:
- Use the harvard referencing style
  - Can't use too many long lists of references. Either have a few references,
    or refer to a table
- Need to somewhere discuss what a swarm plot is and the methodology behind how
  it is generated.
- Need to reference the figures in the text and give stand alone captions
- It seems like the papers which are discussed are a bit arbitrary. Should
  explicitly say that the papers which represent a change in the state of the
  art. This should be done across the different metrics
- Should colour/label/marker the papers which get explicitly referenced
- Need to make the colouring of vision/glove/wifi consistent
- Need to explicitly mention how much of an outlier the 5113 class HMM paper
  is.
- Sometimes paragraphs kinda say the same thing, try to avoid duplicating this.
- Try to really cleanly separate the different metrics: hardware etc
- Have to put in a paragraph "many ML approaches are referenced in this review,
  but are not in the background chapter. The reader is referred to external
  reviews X, Y, Z. Note that all approaches implemented in the thesis are
  discussed in the background"
- Include a section which describes each of the different hardware items and
  the different technology items
  - Probably in a table, in the glossary (?)
- Some papers have multiple technologies: Should clarify this by using
  different colours/styles/markers
- In the lit review: describe
- In the methodology: Need to explicitly describe why building a new glove is
  not really an option and why building a custom glove enabled greater
  fidelity.

This chapter reviews the literature as related to human hand gesture
recognition. There are three primary methods of sensing the movement of a user's
hands: glove-based, vision-based, and WiFi-based systems.

This review is divided into four sections. The first (Section \ref{overview})
will provide an overview of the field and some important metrics which will be
used to compare different works. Section \ref{glove-based-gesture-recognition}
discusses glove-based gesture recognition, and contains the most detail, as the
subject of this thesis is a glove-based system for gesture recognition. Section
\ref{sec:03-vision-and-wifi-based-gesture-recognition} covers other means of
gesture recognition that do not use a physical glove of some sort, namely
vision-based and WiFi-based systems. Section
\ref{applications-of-gesture-recognition} discusses how gesture recognition has
been used over the decades and how that has affected its development.

# Overview

Automatic gesture recognition has gone through several generations since its
first inception in the 1970s, however there are a few fundamental principals
which have survived throughout. The field has largely evaded a well-established
terminology, with different terms being defined for different concepts based on
the requirements at hand. There have also been many projects by hobbyists and
non-academic work done. Nonetheless, these differing definitions are often
guided by similar intuition and so do not result in significant loss of clarity
in the topical understanding of the field. Where confusion may arise, reference
will be made to the existing terminology before defining what will be used in
this review.

Over the years, many authors have published gesture recognition systems, each
dealing with slightly different challenges in their unique ways. This diversity
makes it tricky to compare the various research papers. To address this, this
review will use several metrics to allow for a systematic comparison of
different works in the field. The tasks tackled by different authors may sound
similar, but they vary significantly in difficulty. Note that not all authors
publish enough information to ensure every metric is relevant, and some papers
might have tested multiple systems, resulting in multiple metrics recorded for
that paper.

The metrics are listed below, with short explanations. More detailed
explanations are also given for the metrics which require them.

**Glove/vision/wifi based systems** There are (broadly speaking) three main
categories of gesture capture systems: Glove-based, Vision-based, and (most
recently) WiFi-based systems. Glove-based systems have some instrument
physically connected to the person's hands or forearms. Vision-based systems
use cameras to capture the colour (and possibly also depth) information of the
person performing the gesture. WiFi-based systems are a relatively new
development, and use the noise present in WiFi signals to infer the position of
the human body.

**Technology used** This refers to the underlying technology that enables data
collection, for example: flexion\footnote{Flexion sensors measure the bend of a
strip of plastic which can be attached to a user's finger.} sensors,
accelerometers\footnote{An accelerometer is a sensor that measures
acceleration, most commonly linear acceleration in three orthogonal
directions.}, electromyography\footnote{Electromyography is a technique that
records electrical activity produced by the flexion and extension of skeletal
muscles}, or full-colour cameras\footnote{Also called Red-Green-Blue or RGB
cameras} with depth information.

<!-- TODO: Add graphs about the number of classes -->
<!-- TODO: Add graphs about the number of repetitions -->
<!-- TODO: Add graphs about the number of participants -->

**Number of classes** The number of classes classified by the system. This is
often 26 (one class for each letter _a_ through _z_) or 36 (the letters _a_
through _z_ and the numerals _0_ through _9_).

**Number of participants** The total number of people who contributed gesture
data to the entire dataset, before the dataset is split into
training/validation/testing subsets. A person being recorded in different
locations or on different days is still considered as one person.

**Number of repetitions** The number of observations recorded by each person
for each class. Papers which attempted one-shot learning often only recorded
one repetition for each class.

**Model(s) used** The type of model used to classify the data. Multiple models
can be recorded for each paper, in which case all model types are reported.
Multiple models being attributed to one paper are most often caused by papers
comparing models. When a paper used a derivation of a commonly used model, then
the commonly used model is recorded.

**Hardware used** This is the pre-built hardware used to collect the data. For
example, this might be the Microsoft Kinect\footnote{The Kinect was first
released in 2010 and used RGB cameras with depth information to infer a user's
skeletal structure. Its intended purpose was as a controller for video games.}
or the Nintendo PowerGlove\footnote{The PowerGlove
\citep{abramsgentileentertainmentPowerGlove1989} is a video game controller
accessory first released in 1989 which the user wore as a one-handed glove. It
contained various sensors to measure the position of the user's fingers and had
several buttons built onto the forearm of the glove.}.

**Gestures vs postures** A "gesture" is often used to mean a movement of one or
two hands. A posture (also known as a "static" gesture) is the stationary
position of the user's hands, while a gesture is the movement of the user's
hands over some period of time. This review uses the term "gesture" to cover
both static and dynamic hand movements, with the clarification of "dynamic
gesture" or "static gesture" when confusion could arise. Gestures shall also be
assumed to be of the hands and fingers (and not of the arms or body) unless
explicitly noted.

**Gesture fidelity** The granularity or level-of-detail of the gesture. The
ability to recognise someone waving their arms in the air is very different
from the ability to distinguish the detailed movements required while typing.

The fidelity of a gesture is not often reported directly, despite having great
impact on the difficulty of the problem being attempted. A high-fidelity
gesture would be one which requires the precise control of the user's fingers
or thumbs (such as tapping fingertips together), while a medium-fidelity
gesture would require only the movement of the hand (such the "royal wave"
which doesn't move the arm). A low-fidelity gesture would only require movement
of the whole arm, such as a shaking-of-fists. Higher fidelity gestures are
generally a lot trickier to measure accurately as there are greater degrees of
freedom involved and the absolute amount of motion is less. For ease of
comparison, this review categorises fidelity into three levels:
finger-fidelity, hand-fidelity, and arm-fidelity.

**Explicit and implicit segmentation** Explicit segmentation is where the
continuous time series of data has been segmented such that the start and end
of each gesture is provided to the model. This might be done by marking the
continuous time series and providing those markings to the model, or it might
be done by only training the model on the portions of the time series which
contain gestures. Implicit segmentation requires that the classifier first
detect which observations have gestures and then recognise which gestures are
in those observations.

Gesture _detection_ can be defined as the boolean classification task of
identifying whether any gesture is present in some data sample. Gesture
_recognition_ can be defined as the multi-class classification problem of
identifying _which_ gesture is present in some data sample. Note that a gesture
recognition system could be trained to recognise the lack of a gesture as
itself being a kind of "null" gesture, and so gesture recognition is a
generalisation of gesture detection.

The distinction between detection and recognition will prove useful, as there
have been a number of papers which either 1) train a two-stage system where the
gesture recogniser is only invoked upon successful gesture detection or 2)
completely exclude the task of gesture detection and only train a gesture
recognition system. Some papers only attempt gesture recognition of known
gestures, while other papers attempt both the detection of gestures in a
continuous time series as well as the recognition of those gestures.

Note that only attempting gesture recognition (which assumes every observation
is a valid gesture) drastically reduces the practicality of the developed
model, as any real-world system would need some way to eliminate the portions
of the dataset which do not contain any gestures.

# Glove-based Gesture Recognition

Glove-based gesture recognition can be defined as any gesture recognition
system which gathers hand information using a device physically attached to the
user's hands or upper arms. First the technologies used in building the gloves
will be discussed (subsection \ref{sec:03-technologies-used}). Then an overview of the
seminal papers and larger surveys will be provided (subsection
\ref{landmark-papers}). The hardware products produced (and sometimes sold
commercially) will be discussed in subsection \ref{sec:03-hardware-products}. Datasets
used in glove-based systems (or the lack thereof) will be discussed in
subsection \ref{datasets}. Finally, subsection
\ref{models-and-recognition-techniques} reviews the different models and
recognition techniques used for glove-based gesture recognition.

## Technologies Used \label{sec:03-technologies-used}

<!-- TODO:
You have to make sure it comes across why you made a custom design and not
used one of the existing systems
-->

Different electronic and mechanical technologies have been used over the
decades to instrument the movement of a user's hand or hands. The movement
captured by each system is necessarily limited to one of the following: 1) the
angle between two bones at some joint, 2) the physical touching of two parts of
the hand, 3) the orientation of some part of the hand, or 4) the acceleration
of some part of the fingers. Measuring the angle between two bones has
typically either involved placing a strip of material across the joint and
measuring the stretching of that material, or placing a device capable of
measuring rotation at the axis of rotation of the joint. This subsection will
solely look at technologies used to sense changes in hand or arm position and
the collection of the data. Discussion of how that data is classified will be
done in subsection \ref{models-and-recognition-techniques}.

Early glove-based systems often used hand crafted sensors (presumably due to a
lack of cheap electronic sensors at the time) such as optical tubes which
occluded light when bent \citep{thomasa.defantiUSNEAR60341631977} or flexion
sensors where two parallel conductive metal strips touched when bent
\citep{garyj.grimesUSPatentDigital1981}. Hall-effect
sensors\footnote{Hall-effect sensors measure the surrounding magnetic field and
are often used for precise rotational measurement around an axis.} were used by
some authors\footnote{\cite{jacobsenDesignUtahDextrous1986,
jacobsenUTAHDextrousHand1984, marcusSensingHumanHand1988}} to measure the
rotation of different joints.

Commercially available flex sensors (which measure the bend of a short plastic
strip) were first placed across joints and used successfully in the late 1980s
and early 1990s\footnote{\cite{abramsgentileentertainmentPowerGlove1989,
baudelCharadeRemoteControl1993, felsGloveTalkIIaNeuralnetworkInterface1998,
zimmermanHandGestureInterface1987}}. Flex sensors are unable to accurately
measure very acute angles (such as those between fingers) but are very
intuitive to use and the resulting measurements are easy to interpret. Flex
sensors would see use in commercially sold glove-based systems (discussed in
Section \ref{sec:03-hardware-products}). Flex sensors have since been used in
many papers due to their interpretability and relatively low cost
\footnote{\cite{alviPakistanSignLanguage2007,

yuanHandGestureRecognition2020}}.

Accelerometers measure linear acceleration in up to three axes. Inertial
Measurement Units (IMUs) can measure linear and rotational acceleration,
although the exact details about what is measured often depend on the product
being used. When attached to the user's hand, accelerometers and IMUs provide
low-noise acceleration data which can be used for gesture recognition. Many
mobile devices (such as phones, game controllers, smart watches) contain either
an IMU or an accelerometer and so provide an easily available means of
measuring acceleration while a user holds their device and performs a gesture.

Accelerometers were first used by Fukumoto and Tonomura in 1997
\cite{fukumotoBodyCoupledFingerRing1997}, who mounted them in rings worn at the base
of the user's fingertips. These accelerometers measured the jerk caused when
the user tapped their fingers against a table or flat surface, and mapped the
amount of jerk in certain fingers to certain keystrokes. Acceleration sensors became popular
for gesture recognition due to their small size and
interpretability\footnote{\cite{aklAccelerometerbasedGestureRecognition2010,

zhangStackedLSTMBasedDynamic2021}}.

Surface Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical impulses of a user's
muscles through two or three conductive pads attached to the user's bare skin.
This method generally results in a very noisy signal and does not have the
interpretability of a flex sensor. This often means a more powerful machine
learning technique is required in order to classify the data. Many systems have
used EMG\footnote{\cite{atzoriNinaproDatabaseResource2015,
collialfaroUserIndependentHandGesture2022, jiangDevelopmentRealtimeHand2016,
kimBichannelSensorFusion2008, kochRecurrentNeuralNetwork2019,
kunduHandGestureRecognition2018, moinWearableBiosensingSystem2020,
vasconezHandGestureRecognition2022, wuWearableSystemRecognizing2016,
xuzhangFrameworkHandGesture2011, zhangHandGestureRecognition2009,
zhangRealTimeSurfaceEMG2019}} with a general overview of the field given by
\cite{asgharioskoeiMyoelectricControlSystems2007}.

After the introduction of acceleration and EMG sensors to the field of gesture
recognition, there are a few
papers\footnote{\cite{ammaAirwritingWearableHandwriting2014,
leeSmartWearableHand2018, liHandGestureRecognition2018,
wuWearableSystemRecognizing2016}} which combine the two in a technique often
called "sensor-fusion" to gain better recognition results than either sensor in
isolation.

The changing capacitance of the body has also been used to recognise gestures
\footnote{\cite{rekimotoGestureWristGesturePadUnobtrusive2001,
wongMultiFeaturesCapacitiveHand2021}}.
\cite{rekimotoGestureWristGesturePadUnobtrusive2001} achieved this by using a
bracelet-like device which measures how the capacitance through the upper
forearm changed as the user's muscles moved their fingers.

\cite{wenMachineLearningGlove2020} used triboelectric textile sensors to
measure the stretch of a textile glove.

Figure \ref{fig:03_tech_for_gloves} shows the different technologies used by
glove-based systems over time. Each point is a paper, and the colour of the
point indicates the number of citations. If a paper used multiple technologies,
then it is represented by multiple points, one point for each technology. If
multiple papers are published in the same year and use the same technology,
then they are plotted above or below one another to avoid

For the sake of brevity, not every paper represented in the figures in this
chapter is necessarily cited. The reader is directed to the Zenodo dataset
containing the author's database of approximately 750 papers, theses, and
websites which were used to construct these plots. The code required to

## Landmark Papers

The inaugural investigation into glove-based input was undertaken by
\cite{sturmanSurveyGlovebasedInput1994} (following Sturman's dissertation on
whole-hand input \citep{sturmanWholehandInput1992}). Sturman and Zeltzer's
survey comprehensively examined the predominant glove-based systems that were
accessible during that period and delves into their respective applications.
Regrettably, the primary accounts concerning these systems have succumbed to
the passage of time, often rendering Sturman and Zeltzer's work as the sole
surviving repository of knowledge on the state of the field during that time.

Following this survey, the interest in hand gesture recognition increased
significantly, prompting the survey by \cite{laviolaSurveyHandPosture1999}
which discussed the models and techniques used for glove and vision based
classification.

\cite{mitraGestureRecognitionSurvey2007} surveyed the software and modelling
developments for human gesture recognition (including face and head tracking).
shortly after which \cite{dipietroSurveyGloveBasedSystems2008} described the
state of glove-based input and focused on how the technology has evolved,
providing a comprehensive summary of the different systems and how they compare
to one another.

Following 2008, there have been several smaller reviews of the literature
\footnote{\cite{anwarHandGestureRecognition2019, chenSurveyHandGesture2013,
chenSurveyHandPose2020, harshithSurveyVariousGesture2010,
kudrinkoWearableSensorBasedSign2021, rashidWearableTechnologiesHand2019,
raysarkarHandGestureRecognition2013}} however these reviews are often lacking
the depth of prior work.

## Hardware Products \label{sec:03-hardware-products}

Commercially available gloves which can measure the movement of a user's hands
often result in research using those gloves, as the researchers capable of
purchasing a glove-based system are a strict subset of the researchers capable
of designing and building a glove-based system. The researchers who do not have
the expertise to build their own glove-based system must use a commercially
available system if they wish to perform research in this area. This subsection
explores hardware products which have been used for glove-based gesture
recognition.

The Computer Image Corporation of Denver, Colorado developed the Animac
\cite{experimentaltelevisioncenterComputerImageCorporation1969} (later named
the
[Scanimate](https://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=442))
between 1962 and 1971 which performed full-body position capture for use in
computer graphics, but did not have the fidelity for finger-level gesture
capture.

\end{figure}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The SayreGlove \citep{thomasa.defantiUSNEAR60341631977} is often credited as the
first glove-based system developed. It used a combination of optical tubes
which occluded light when bent and parallel conductive pads which touched and
therefore conducted electricity when bent to sense the movement of the user's
hand.

In the 1990s there were three main commercially available products: The
DataGlove developed by Visual Programming Languages (VPL)
\citep{sturmanSurveyGlovebasedInput1994}, the PowerGlove developed by Abrams
Gentile Entertainment for Nintendo
\citep{abramsgentileentertainmentPowerGlove1989}, and the CyberGlove by
Immersion Inc\. \citep{immersioncorporationCyberGlove2001}. These gloves were
similar in nature, with some combination of flex sensors over the phalanges and
accelerometers mounted on the back of the hands. They were occasionally used
with the Polhemus tracker\footnote{\cite{baudelCharadeRemoteControl1993,
felsGloveTalkIIaNeuralnetworkInterface1998, fisherTelepresenceMasterGlove1987,
wengaoChineseSignLanguage2004, wilsonParametricHiddenMarkov1999}} which mounted
onto each glove and allowed the approximate location of the glove in 3D space
to be triangulated.

The Utah/M.I.T\.\footnote{Massachusetts Institute of Technology} Dexterous Hand
\cite{jacobsenUTAHDextrousHand1984} and the associated Utah/M.I.T\. Dexterous
HandMaster \citep{jacobsenDesignUtahDextrous1986} was a complex system that
included both a controller which sensed the position of a human hand through a
series of hall-effect sensors (the HandMaster) and a robotic hand which could
be controlled by this HandMaster.

\cite{marcusSensingHumanHand1988} used the VPL DataGlove to control the
Utah/MIT Dexterous Hand, followed by an independent study by
\cite{hongCalibratingVPLDataGlove1989} confirming the same results in 1989.

The Nintendo Wii Remote (often called the Wiimote) was a cheap, commercially
available game controller developed in 2006 for the Nintendo Wii. It contained
a 3-axis accelerometer and so was used by several researchers to explore
gesture recognition using the acceleration data it
provided\footnote{\cite{hamdyaliComparativeStudyUser2014,
kratzWiizards3DGesture2007, liuUWaveAccelerometerbasedPersonalized2009,
netoHighLevelProgramming2010, schlomerGestureRecognitionWii2008,
wuGestureRecognition3D2009}}.

Figure \ref{fig:03_hardware_for_gloves} shows the different kinds of hardware
used over time for glove-based gesture recognition systems.

    \cite{felsGloveTalkIIaNeuralnetworkInterface1998}, the Technische

    \cite{hofmannVelocityProfileBased1998}, and the Microsoft Band2 by
    \cite{liHandGestureRecognition2018}. The 5DT DataGlove refers to the
    glove developed by Fifth Dimension Technologies
    \citep{fifthdimensiontechnologies5DTHardware}.}
    \label{fig:03_hardware_for_gloves}
\end{figure}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

The development of mobile devices with integrated IMU microchips also inspired
development, with several papers proposing systems where the user would simply
hold their smart phone \citep{xieAccelerometerGestureRecognition2014}, smart watch
\citep{xuFingerwritingSmartwatchCase2015}, or Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)
\citep{kelaAccelerometerbasedGestureControl2006} in their hand and perform a gesture
which would control the device.

The development of the MyoWare Armband resulted in several
papers\footnote{\cite{vasconezHandGestureRecognition2022,
collialfaroUserIndependentHandGesture2022, zhangRealTimeSurfaceEMG2019}} using
the device for EMG measurements and gesture recognition, as did the Delsys
Myomonitor IV\footnote{\cite{zhangHandGestureRecognition2009,
kimBichannelSensorFusion2008}}. Notably,
\cite{moinWearableBiosensingSystem2020} developed a custom sheet of very
densely clustered EMG sensors which wrapped around the forearm of the user and
could infer simple gestures, significantly surpassing the resolution of
previous systems.

## Datasets

There is a lack of commonly used datasets for glove-based systems due to the
lack of commonly used hardware solutions. Some researchers have recently
started making their datasets and code public in the interest of
reproducibility. However, there are no datasets in common use as it is often
easier to develop custom hardware than to try and recreate another researcher's
hardware. Much of the existing hardware used for glove-based systems have
significant flaws, and these flaws incentivise the development of new hardware
and new datasets. It is likely that commonly used datasets will only become
widely used if the type of hardware used to create those datasets becomes
standardised. The primary reason for this is the difficulty in minimising costs
while avoiding a product too simple to be useful in a wide variety of
situations and research fields. The SoapBox
\citep{tuulariSoapBoxPlatformUbiquitous2002} was proposed as such a device, but
it did not receive widespread adoption.

The widespread adoption of some standard glove-based system would likely
accelerate the development of superior gesture recognition systems, as curious
researchers would not have to create the hardware themselves but would be able
to focus on creating the classification models. This has already occurred in
vision-based systems, where there now exist widely used datasets recorded on
standard and easily available hardware (see subsection
\ref{sec:03-vision-and-wifi-based-gesture-recognition}).

## Models and Recognition Techniques

Different techniques have been applied to recognise gestures. The exact
application of the model depends on the dataset collected, however some high
level trends can be noticed. The datasets being classified often take the form
of a multi-dimensional time series. Figure \ref{fig:03_models_glove_based}
shows the models used over time for glove-based gesture recognition.

Early on in the field, many researchers extracted a custom-designed feature
vector from their data and trained a model on that feature vector. Following
this, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been favoured due to their explicit
encoding of time-dependant data, and have been used by many papers for
glove-based gesture
recognition\footnote{\cite{ammaAirwritingWearableHandwriting2014,

Other popular systems employed for gesture recognition have been Support Vector
Machines (SVMs)\footnote{\cite{ammaAirwritingWearableHandwriting2014,

Neural Network based approaches first appeared when
\cite{murakamiGestureRecognitionUsing1991} used a recurrent neural network to
classify a dataset of 42 classes. The recent increase in computational power
has allowed neural networks and their variants to be fully utilised for
glove-based gesture recognition: Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs)
\footnote{\cite{damasioAnimatingVirtualHumans2002, fatmiComparingANNSVM2019,

\footnote{\cite{kochRecurrentNeuralNetwork2019,

\footnote{\cite{maHandGestureRecognition2017, wenMachineLearningGlove2020,
yuanHandGestureRecognition2020}}, and Self-Organising Feature Maps (SOMs,
\cite{wengaoChineseSignLanguage2004}) have all shown good results.

HMMs have been used by Chunli and Wen to classify thousands of unique
gestures from Chinese Sign Language between 2001 and 2004: 4800 in
\citep{wangchunliRealTimeLargeVocabulary2001}, 5100 in
\citep{wangchunliRealTimeLargeVocabulary2002} , and 5113 in
\cite{wengaoChineseSignLanguage2004}. To accomplish this,
\cite{wengaoChineseSignLanguage2004} applied a multi-stage approach, where a
Self-Organising Feature Map (SOM) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the
input data. A simple Recurrent Neural Network was used to detect if there was a
gesture in a particular observation, and then (conditional on a positive
detection) a set of 5113 HMMs were used to recognise which gesture was in that
observation. They applied a heavily modified version of the Viterbi algorithm
(which they named the "lattice" Viterbi Algorithm) to efficiently evaluate the
log-likelihood of the thousands of HMMs.

# Vision- and WiFi-based Gesture Recognition \label{sec:03-vision-and-wifi-based-gesture-recognition}

This section focuses on non-glove-based gesture recognition, which resolves to
just two categories: vision-based (using visible light and depth data), and
WiFi-based (using the effect the human body has on diagnostic information
collected in WiFi networks). This section will not be as detailed as Section
\ref{glove-based-gesture-recognition}, due to the focus of the thesis being
glove-based systems. There is a wealth of research in these two fields, with
recent review papers of WiFi-based systems citing between 100 and 150 papers
\footnote{\cite{maWiFiSensingChannel2020,
hussainReviewCategorizationTechniques2020, wangCSIbasedHumanSensing2021,
maSurveyWiFiBased2016}}. Recent reviews of vision-based systems cited between
100 and 270 papers \footnote{\cite{rautarayVisionBasedHand2015,
cheokReviewHandGesture2019, oudahHandGestureRecognition2020}}. While the number
of papers cited is not a precise measure of the size of the field, is does
provide an approximation. The interested reader is directed towards those
reviews for a more detailed treatment of the material.

**How vision-based systems work** Vision-based systems collect visual data
using video cameras and more recently, depth information, either using
LiDAR\footnote{LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing
technology that employs laser beams to measure distances and obtain precise
three-dimensional representations of a space.} or by measuring the reflection
of a known infrared projection. The field has evolved with improved
hardware: earlier systems did not have depth information, had lower-resolution
images, did not have colour information, and had fewer frames per second when
compared to modern hardware.

**How WiFi-based systems work** The technology enabling gesture-recognition
with WiFi was implemented in the IEEE 802.11n standard released in 2009
\cite{IEEEStandardInformation2009a}. This standard introduced Channel State
Information (CSI) which provided significantly more information about the noise
in an environment than was previously available. CSI allows transmitters in a
WiFi network to change how they transmit data based on the current channel
conditions, which enables more reliable communication.

Since CSI is very sensitive to the surrounding environment, changes such as a
person moving within a room \citep{wuWiTrajRobustIndoor2023} or even just breathing
\citep{wangWeCanHear2014} can induce a change in the CSI, which can then be
recognised using modern machine learning techniques.

**Datasets** Both vision- and WiFi-based systems have seen the benefit of
standardised hardware that enables the creation of high-quality and diverse
datasets of gestures being performed and recorded on relevant hardware. These
datasets\footnote{\cite{guyonChaLearnGestureChallenge2012,
materzynskaJesterDatasetLargeScale2019,
alazraiDatasetWiFibasedHumantohuman2020}} promote research in the field, as
they provide a common baseline against which new algorithms can be tested.

Vision based systems have been investigated since the 1980s
\footnote{\cite{boltPutthatthereVoiceGesture1980,
jenningsComputergraphicModelingAnalysis1988,
myronw.kruegerArtificialRealityII1991}} but the first working system was
\cite{yamatoRecognizingHumanAction1992} which recognised human actions using an
HMM trained to recognise feature vectors.
\cite{starnerRealtimeAmericanSign1995} were the first to use vision-based
systems to recognise sign language gestures, using HMMs to recognise 40 signs
from the American Sign Language. Due to the computational power available at
the time, the user had to wear brightly coloured gloves to aid in hand
detection and the system ran at 5 frames per second. HMMs paired with some form
of manual feature extraction would remain the favoured modelling technique for
vision-based systems for many years to
come\footnote{\cite{binhRealTimeHandTracking2005,

\cite{halperinToolReleaseGathering2011} published a tool which provided
a detailed picture of the wireless channel conditions using CSI information. The
release of this tool made apparent the level of detail available in CSI and how
that information changes with changes to the environment. Adib and Katabi first
applied the data available in CSI to recognise human gestures
\citep{adibSeeWallsWiFi2013} and were followed by papers investigating many
diverse applications such as breathing
detection\footnote{\cite{liuWiSleepContactlessSleep2014,
wangHumanRespirationDetection2016, wuNonInvasiveDetectionMoving2015}}, sign
language recognition \citep{liWiFingerTalkYour2016}, fall detection
\footnote{\cite{wangRTFallRealTimeContactless2017,
wangWiFallDeviceFreeFall2017}}, distinguishing different people from one
another based on their movement or gait\footnote{\cite{
wangGaitRecognitionUsing2016, zengWiWhoWiFiBasedPerson2016,
zhangWiFiIDHumanIdentification2016}}, keystroke and password inference
\footnote{\cite{aliRecognizingKeystrokesUsing2017, liWhenCSIMeets2016,
shenWiPassCSIbasedKeystroke2020}}, sleep detection
\citep{liuWiSleepContactlessSleep2014}, speech recognition
\citep{wangWeCanHear2014}, and the monitoring of vital signs
\citep{liuTrackingVitalSigns2015}.

The applications of vision-based gesture recognition have been less varied,
with an emphasis on sign
language\footnote{\cite{avolaExploitingRecurrentNeural2019,

\footnote{\cite{freemanOrientationHistogramsHand1995,

and remote robot control\footnote{\cite{qiMultiSensorGuidedHand2021,

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were first used for gesture recognition in
2015 by \cite{jiehuangSignLanguageRecognition2015} and

# Applications of Gesture Recognition

One of the most common applications for gesture recognition is classification
of the sign language local to the researcher. Figure
\ref{fig:03_sl_applications} shows the multitude of sign languages which have
been reported as the application of various gesture recognition research.

    sign languages to which gesture recognition has been applied.}
    \label{fig:03_sl_applications}
\end{figure}

Sign languages appear ideal at first glance, as they provide a large set of
non-trivial gestures which do not require extensive description. The ability to
automatically translate a sign language into a spoken language has immediate
and clear benefit. However, sign language communication goes beyond the simple
hand signs that are popularly shown in simple charts. Sign languages include
non-manual markers which use the face or body posture of the signer to convey
grammatical structure and lexical distinctions, for example questions or
negations. This means that the common task of developing a system to recognise
sign language is often reported as a complete system, even though it is a
partial solution. This has raised some critique from sign language communities,
however it should be noted that many authors use gestures from their local sign
language simply as a useful collection of gestures, and the fact that the
gestures have distinct meaning is not of direct interest to the research being
performed. An analogy can be made to the Utah Teapot\footnote{A commonly used
baseline used to evaluate computer graphics programs,
\cite{torrenceMartinNewellOriginal2006}}, common in computer graphics research.
The utility of the Utah Teapot is not that it is an accurate representation of
a specific teapot, but rather that it is a shape complex enough to be
non-trivial and common enough that it does not require significant explanation.
Similarly, The utility of using gestures from a sign language is not that they
have semantic meaning, but rather that they are complex enough to be
non-trivial and common enough that they do not require significant explanation.
