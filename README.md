# Corrections & Improvements

On 13 February 2024, the following corrections and suggestions were improved.
They have been summarised:

> Foot note in middle of the page on page 61 (issue with LaTeX floating
> environments, figure 4.2) (NOTE: this seems to have fixed itself as other
> changes were made to the PDF)

> They _really_ didn't like the dim yellow used in the `Spectral` colour
> palette, need to create a custom colour map to solve this. (or maybe I can
> get away with setting an outline for all of the points)

> y-axes (for the confusion matrices, and "many graphs") have zero at the top,
> where the convention is to have zero at the bottom.

> "Axes annotations on some graphs are very crowded. Try using a smaller font"

- Probably referring to fig 5.29
